### Abstract
All-solid-state thin supercapacitors have been fabricated using current pulse polymerized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) over carbon fiber paper and ionic liquid based gel polymer electrolyte. The PEDOT-coated carbon paper electrodes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) which confirm the porous morphology of PEDOT at the nanoscale and a high degree of  dopant ion conjugation. The performance characteristics of the supercapacitor cells have been evaluated by ac impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge techniques. The PEDOT electrode shows specific capacitance of ∼154.5 F g−1, which correspond to the cell area-normalized capacitance of 85 mF cm−2. The maximum specific energy and specific power of the solid-state supercapacitor cell, calculated from charge-discharge characteristics, are 6.5 Wh kg−1 and 11.3 kW kg−1, respectively. The solid-state supercapacitor shows good cycle durability and time stability. The thin, lightweight, gel electrolyte based supercapacitor shows considerable potential for low-cost, high-performance energy storage applications.

### 1. Introduction
In recent years, electrochemical capacitors, also known as supercapacitors, have received much attention as an attractive power/energy storage device due to their high power density, fast charging and discharging rates, long cycle life, and high reliability [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. These devices are being used in a variety of applications, including consumer electronics, medical electronics, memory back-up systems, military devices, electrical utilities, hybrid electric vehicles, and large industrial scale power and energy management [5], [6]. However, the energy and power densities, safety, and cycle life of currently available supercapacitors need to be significantly improved to fulfill the demand for new generation of miniaturized consumer electronic devices [7]. The optimization of supercapacitor performance can be realized by considering several key structural parameters such as electrode components, open accessibility by electrolyte, and the interfacial structure between the electronically active material and current collector [8], [9].  
近年来，电化学电容器，也称为超级电容器，由于其高功率密度，快速充电和放电速率，长循环寿命和高可靠性而作为有吸引力的电力/储能装置受到了很多关注[1]，[2] ]，[3]，[4]，[5]。这些设备用于各种应用，包括消费电子，医疗电子，存储备份系统，军事设备，电力设施，混合动力电动汽车，以及大型工业规模的电力和能源管理[5]，[6]。然而，当前可用的超级电容器的能量和功率密度，安全性和循环寿命需要得到显着改善，以满足对新一代小型化消费电子设备的需求[7]。超级电容器性能的优化可以通过考虑几个关键结构参数来实现，例如电极组件，电解质的开放可达性，以及电子活性材料和集电器之间的界面结构[8]，[9]。

The supercapacitor electrode materials can be divided into three categories: carbon materials, conducting polymers, and transition metal oxides [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. Among these, electronically conducting polymers have been intensively investigated as supercapacitor electrode material due to the fast kinetics of the electrochemical charge-discharge (doping-dedoping) processes which pervades throughout its volume and have high charge density. In addition, they are relatively cheap and have good intrinsic auto-conductivity. However, the lower power density and the capacity loss during continuous charge/discharge (doping-dedoping) processes are the major issues which limit the practical application of the conducting polymer based supercapacitors [14]. Various approaches have been adopted to improve the performance of the conducting polymer based supercapacitor including incorporation of carbon materials (carbon nanotubes, graphene etc.), synthesis of conducting polymer in various nanostructure forms and different substrates [9], [17], [18], [19].  
超级电容器电极材料可分为三类：碳材料，导电聚合物和过渡金属氧化物[10]，[11]，[12]，[13]，[14]，[15]，[16]。其中，由于电化学充电 -放电（掺杂 -去掺杂）过程的快速动力学遍及其整个体积并具有高电荷密度，因此电子导电聚合物作为超级电容器电极材料已经被深入研究。此外，它们相对便宜并且具有良好的固有自导性。然而，在连续充电/放电（掺杂 -去掺杂）过程中较低的功率密度和容量损失是限制基于导电聚合物的超级电容器的实际应用的主要问题[14]。已经采用各种方法来改善基于导电聚合物的超级电容器的性能，包括结合碳材料（碳纳米管，石墨烯等），合成各种纳米结构形式的导电聚合物和不同的基板[9]，[17]，[18] ]，[19]。

Among the conducting polymers, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is a potential electrode material due to its high conductivity and relatively much higher chemical and mechanical stability [20], [21], [22], [23] However, its specific capacitance is relatively low compared to the other conducting polymers e.g. polyaniline, polypyorrle and thiophene-based polymers such as poly(3-methylthiophene) [24]. To increase the specific capacitance, formation of composites with nanostructured carbon, modified microstructure and novel dopant schemes have been investigated [21], [25], [26]. Various techniques for PEDOT electrode preparation using the sulphonate doped aqueous emulsions and chemical polymerization or electro-oxidation of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) monomer have been reported to optimize its performance [27], [28]. Recently, a pulsed electropolymerization method has been reported to form PEDOT films with highly porous microstructure at the nanoscale and with higher degree of dopant ion conjugation [29]. This technique has recently been reported for the electrochemical deposition of polypyorrle electrodes [30], [31].  
在导电聚合物中，聚（3,4-亚乙二氧基噻吩）（PEDOT）是一种潜在的电极材料，因为它具有高导电性和相对高得多的化学和机械稳定性[20]，[21]，[22]，[23] ，与其他导电聚合物相比，其比电容相对较低聚苯胺，polypyorrle和噻吩基聚合物，如聚（3-甲基噻吩）[24]。为了增加比电容，已经研究了具有纳米结构碳的复合材料的形成，改性的微结构和新的掺杂剂方案[21]，[25]，[26]。已经报道了使用磺酸盐掺杂的水乳液和3,4-亚乙二氧基噻吩（EDOT）单体的化学聚合或电氧化制备PEDOT电极的各种技术以优化其性能[27]，[28]。最近，已经报道了脉冲电聚合方法形成PEDOT薄膜，其具有纳米级的高孔隙微结构并且具有更高程度的掺杂剂离子共轭[29]。最近报道了这种技术用于多发性电极的电化学沉积[30]，[31]。

A suitable solid electrolyte is an important component in the solid-state supercapacitors. Supercapacitors based on the solid electrolytes are compact, more reliable, environmentally safe, and have long shelf life due to low internal corrosion. Recently, the development of high-performance all-solid-state supercapacitors has received considerable attention by various research groups [32], [33], [34], [35]. However, reports on PEDOT based all solid-state supercapacitor are limited [36], [37]. The gel polymer electrolytes are basically the liquid electrolyte (an ionic salt dissolved into an organic solvent) immobilized in a polymeric network which possess both the cohesive properties of solids and the diffusive transport properties of liquids [38], [39]. However, the poor thermal and electrochemical properties of organic electrolytes limit the performance of the gel electrolyte based supercapacitors [39]. Ionic liquids (ILs), the room temperature molten salts composed of organic cation (and anion) are being considered as an alternative to the aprotic organic solvents due to their low vapor pressure, excellent chemical and thermal stability, and wider electrochemical potential window [40].  
合适的固体电解质是固态超级电容器中的重要组分。基于固体电解质的超级电容器结构紧凑，更可靠，对环境安全，并且由于低内部腐蚀而具有长保质期。最近，高性能全固态超级电容器的开发受到了各种研究小组的广泛关注[32]，[33]，[34]，[35]。然而，基于PEDOT的全固态超级电容器的报道是有限的[36]，[37]。凝胶聚合物电解质基本上是固定在聚合物网络中的液体电解质（溶解在有机溶剂中的离子盐），其具有固体的内聚性和液体的扩散传输性[38]，[39]。然而，有机电解质的不良热和电化学性质限制了基于凝胶电解质的超级电容器的性能[39]。离子液体（ILs），由有机阳离子（和阴离子）组成的室温熔盐被认为是非质子有机溶剂的替代品，因为它们具有低蒸气压，优异的化学和热稳定性以及更宽的电化学势窗[40]。

In the present study, we demonstrate that high performance thin, lightweight supercapacitors can be fabricated using PEDOT coated carbon fiber paper electrodes and ionic liquid gel polymer electrolyte. Carbon fiber paper has been selected as substrate for electropolymerization of PEDOT owing to their high surface area with porous 3-D structure, high conductivity, and chemical stability, lightweight and low cost. The porous structure of carbon fiber paper is expected to facilitate the fast diffusion of ions into the electrode material. The performance characteristics of the supercapacitors have been evaluated by a.c. impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge tests. The solid-state supercapacitor shows good cycling performance and time stability.
