### Abstract
All-solid-state flexible supercapacitors were fabricated using carbon nanotubes (CNTs), regular office papers, and ionic-liquid-based gel electrolytes. Flexible electrodes were made by coating CNTs on office papers by a drop-dry method. The gel electrolyte was prepared by mixing fumed silica nanopowders with ionic liquid, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([EMIM][NTf2]). This supercapacitor showed high power and energy performance as a solid-state flexible supercapacitor. The specific capacitance of the CNT electrodes was 135 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1, when considering the mass of active materials only. The maximum power and energy density of the supercapacitors were 164 kW kg−1 and 41 Wh kg−1, respectively. Interestingly, the solid-state supercapacitor with the gel electrolyte showed comparable performance to the supercapacitors with ionic-liquid electrolyte. Moreover, the supercapacitor showed excellent stability and flexibility. The CNT/paper- and gel-based supercapacitors may hold great potential for low-cost and high-performance flexible energy storage applications.  
全固态柔性超级电容器使用碳纳米管（CNT），常规办公用纸和离子液体凝胶电解质制造。通过滴干法在办公用纸上涂覆CNT制备柔性电极。通过将热解法二氧化硅纳米粉末与离子液体1-乙基-3-甲基咪唑双（三氟甲基磺酰基）酰亚胺（[EMIM] [NTf2]）混合来制备凝胶电解质。这种超级电容器作为固态柔性超级电容器显示出高功率和高能量性能。当仅考虑活性材料的质量时，在电流密度为2Ag-1时，CNT电极的比电容为135F g-1。超级电容器的最大功率和能量密度分别为164 kW kg-1和41 Wh kg-1。有趣的是，具有凝胶电解质的固态超级电容器显示出与具有离子液体电解质的超级电容器相当的性能。此外，超级电容器显示出优异的稳定性和柔韧性。基于CNT/纸和凝胶的超级电容器可以在低成本和高性能的灵活能量存储应用中具有巨大潜力。

### 1. Introduction
Development of flexible energy storage devices is of great importance for applications in emerging flexible and wearable electronics [1–3]. Among various energy storage devices, supercapacitors have been considered as one of the most promising candidates owing to their high power density, long cycle lifetime, low environmental impact, and safety [4, 5]. Realization of high-performance supercapacitors for flexible electronics would require consideration of electrochemical, mechanical, and interfacial properties of main components such as electrode, separator, electrolyte, and supporting substrate [2]. For example, active electrode material needs to have high surface area and electrical conductivity. On the other hand, electrolyte should be made of flexible solid-state materials. In addition, the assembly of the components should have high mechanical integrity.

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) coated on paper could be an attractive component of a supercapacitor. CNTs have intrinsically excellent material properties as active materials such as high specific surface area, high conductivity, high flexibility, regular pore structures, and electrochemical stability [6–8]. Regular office papers are low cost and flexible, and potentially useful for various applications including energy storage [9–11]. Recently, it has been demonstrated that CNTs can be firmly integrated onto papers and used for supercapacitor applications [12, 13]. Although the high potential of the CNT-coated paper (CNT/paper) as a supercapacitor component has been demonstrated, most of the characterization was carried out on liquid electrolytes, which inherently have leakage and integrity problems [13–20]. Therefore, employment of solid-state and flexible electrolytes is highly desirable for flexible supercapacitor applications.

In this work, we demonstrate that high-performance flexible supercapacitors can be fabricated using CNT/papers and ionic-liquid- and silica-based gel electrolytes. Interestingly, the solid-state supercapacitor with the gel electrolyte showed comparable performance to the supercapacitors with ionic-liquid electrolyte. Moreover, it was far superior to the supercapacitors with conventionally used poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-based polymer electrolytes in terms of both power and energy density. Specific capacitance, maximum power and energy density were 134.6 F g−1, 164 kW kg−1, and 41 Wh kg−1, respectively. The demonstrated high performance of the CNT/paper-based supercapacitors would be an important cornerstone for the development of flexible energy storage devices.

### 2. Experimental section
CNTs were grown by water-assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) as described elsewhere [7]. CNT ink solution was prepared by dispersing 20 mg of CNTs with 20 mg of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) surfactant in 20 ml of deionized water. The CNT dispersion was bath-sonicated for 5 min and then bar-sonicated (Sonics & Materials, VC 750) for 20 min. Approximately 0.2 ml of the CNT ink was drop-dried on a regular office paper with an area of 1 cm × 1 cm and dried at 80 °C for 4 h in an oven. The total mass of the CNT and the surfactant was in the range of 0.40–0.45 mg, leading to a CNT density of 0.20–0.23 mg cm−2.  
Ionic-liquid-based gel electrolyte was fabricated by adding 167 mg of fumed silica nanopowder (Sigma-Aldrich, average particle size ~14 nm) in 5 ml of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([EMIM][NTf2], C-TRI). The mixture of the silica and the ionic liquid [EMIM][NTf2] was magnetically stirred for 6 h in a nitrogen atmosphere prepared using a Schlenk line. H2SO4/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) electrolyte was prepared by mixing 20 mg of PVA and 1.1 ml of H2SO4 via magnetic stirring in 20 ml of deionized water at 85 °C for 8 h.  
The electrolyte was coated on each CNT/paper using Meyer rods and dried at room temperature under vacuum for ~24 h. Once a thin layer of solid electrolyte was formed on each CNT/paper, another electrolyte layer was applied to one of the CNT/papers to attach two of them together. The stacked CNT/papers were gently pushed over the entire area and dried under the same conditions as described above. The total thickness of the assembly was approximately 720 μm.  
The structure and morphology of the CNTs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S4300) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Philips Tecnai 20). The quality of the CNTs was evaluated by Raman spectroscopy (Horiba HR800). Electrochemical properties were investigated using an electrochemical analyzer (Ivium Technologies, CompactStat) in a two electrode configuration under vacuum. The specific surface area of the carbon nanotubes was measured via the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method using a BELSORP-mini II (BEL Japan).

CNT通过水辅助化学气相沉积（CVD）生长，如其他地方所述[7]。通过将20mg CNT与20mg十二烷基苯磺酸钠（SDBS）表面活性剂分散在20ml去离子水中来制备CNT油墨溶液。将CNT分散体浴超声处理5分钟，然后进行棒超声处理（Sonics＆Materials，VC 750）20分钟。将约0.2ml的CNT油墨在面积为1cm×1cm的普通办公用纸上进行滴干，并在80℃下在烘箱中干燥4小时。 CNT和表面活性剂的总质量在0.40-0.45mg的范围内，导致CNT密度为0.20-0.23mg cm-2。  
通过将167mg热解法二氧化硅纳米粉末（Sigma-Aldrich，平均粒径~14nm）加入5ml 1-乙基-3-甲基咪唑双（三氟甲基磺酰基）酰亚胺([EMIM][NTf2], C-TRI)中来制造离子液体基凝胶电解质。将二氧化硅和离子液体[EMIM] [NTf2]的混合物在使用Schlenk管线制备的氮气氛中磁力搅拌6小时。通过在20ml去离子水中在85℃下磁力搅拌将20mg PVA和1.1ml H2SO4混合8小时来制备H2SO4/聚乙烯醇（PVA）电解质。  
使用Meyer棒将电解质涂覆在每个CNT /纸上，并在室温下在真空下干燥~24小时。一旦在每个CNT /纸上形成薄的固体电解质层，就将另一个电解质层施加到CNT /纸之一上以将它们中的两个连接在一起。将堆叠的CNT /纸轻轻推过整个区域并在与上述相同的条件下干燥。组件的总厚度约为720μm。  
通过扫描电子显微镜（SEM，Hitachi S4300）和透射电子显微镜（TEM，Philips Tecnai 20）表征CNT的结构和形态。通过拉曼光谱（Horiba HR800）评估CNT的质量。使用电化学分析仪（Ivium Technologies，CompactStat）在真空下以双电极配置研究电化学性质。使用BELSORP-mini II（BEL Japan），通过Brunauer-Emmett-Teller（BET）法测量碳纳米管的比表面积。
