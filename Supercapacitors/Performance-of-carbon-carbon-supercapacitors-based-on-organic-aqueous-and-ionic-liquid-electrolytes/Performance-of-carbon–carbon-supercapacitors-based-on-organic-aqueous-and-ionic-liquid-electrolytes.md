### Abstract
Properties of capacitors working with the same carbon electrodes (activated carbon cloth) and three types of electrolytes: aqueous, organic and ionic liquids were compared. Capacitors filled with ionic liquids worked at a potential difference of 3.5 V, their solutions in AN and PC were charged up to the potential difference of 3 V, classical organic systems to 2.5 V and aqueous to 1 V. Cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charging/discharging and impedance spectroscopy were used to characterize these capacitors. The highest specific energy was recorded for the device working with ionic liquids, while the highest power is characteristic for the device filled with aqueous H2SO4 electrolyte. Aqueous electrolytes led to energy density an order of magnitude lower in comparison to that characteristic of ionic liquids.  
使用相同碳电极（活性炭布）和三种电解质（水性，有机和离子液体）的电容器的性质进行了比较。填充离子液体的电容器工作电位差为3.5 V，它们在AN和PC中的溶液充电至3 V的电位差，经典有机系统充电至2.5 V，水溶液充电至1 V.循环伏安，恒电流充电/放电和阻抗谱用于表征这些电容器。记录了使用离子液体的装置的最高比能，而最高功率是装有H2SO4水溶液的装置的特征。与离子液体的特性相比，含水电解质导致能量密度低一个数量级。

### 1. Introduction
Electrochemical capacitors are energy storage systems [1], [2], [3] which may be used in portable devices, hybrid vehicles and back-up systems [4], [5]. The term electrochemical capacitor or supercapacitor [6] refers to electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) [7], [8], [9], redox capacitors [10], [11], [12] and electronically conductive polymer-based capacitors (ECPs) [13], [14], [15], [16]. In EDLCs energy is stored in the electric double-layer formed at the electrode/electrolyte interface. While redox capacitors and ECP based capacitors are still at the research phase, EDLCs are commercialized as computer power supply systems and developed as power supply systems in hybrid cars [17]. EDLCs consist of two active materials; i.e. a high surface carbon electrode and electrolyte. The electrolyte may be aqueous [18], organic (where usually acetonitrile (AN) or propylene carbonate (PC) are applied as solvents [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33]), a solvent-free ionic liquid [34], [35], [36], [37] or polymer gel electrolyte [38], [39], [40], [41], [42]. Inspection of original papers and review articles [43], [44], [45], [46] suggests that most of EDLC research is devoted to the preparation of new carbons and studies of their performance as electrode materials. Moreover, specific capacitance of the carbon/electrolyte system is usually expressed in Farads per mass of carbon and often treated as an individual property of carbon [43], [44], [45], [46]. Only few papers are devoted to the comparison of electrolytes [47], [48]. The general aim of this work is to compare properties of EDLCs based on different types of electrolytes – aqueous, organic and ionic liquids, working with the same carbon electrode.  
电化学电容器是储能系统[1]，[2]，[3]，可用于便携式设备，混合动力汽车和备用系统[4]，[5]。术语电化学电容器或超级电容器[6]是指电化学双层电容器（EDLC）[7]，[8]，[9]，氧化还原电容器[10]，[11]，[12]和基于电子导电聚合物的电化学电容器电容器（ECPs）[13]，[14]，[15]，[16]。在EDLC中，能量存储在电极/电解质界面处形成的双电层中。虽然氧化还原电容器和基于ECP的电容器仍处于研究阶段，但EDLC已作为计算机电源系统商业化，并在混合动力汽车中作为电源系统开发[17]。EDLC由两种活性材料组成;即高表面碳电极和电解质。电解质可以是含水的[18]，有机的（通常用乙腈（AN）或碳酸亚丙酯（PC）作为溶剂[19]，[20]，[21]，[22]，[23]，[24] ，[25]，[26]，[27]，[28]，[29]，[30]，[31]，[32]，[33]），一种无溶剂的离子液体[34]，[35] ]，[36]，[37]或聚合物凝胶电解质[38]，[39]，[40]，[41]，[42]。检查原始论文和评论文章[43]，[44]，[45]，[46]表明，大多数EDLC研究致力于新碳的制备和它们作为电极材料性能的研究。此外，碳/电解质体系的比电容通常以每质量碳的法拉数表示，并且通常作为碳的单独性质处理[43]，[44]，[45]，[46]。只有少数论文致力于电解质的比较[47]，[48]。这项工作的一般目的是比较基于不同类型电解质的EDLC的性质-水，有机和离子液体，使用相同的碳电极。

Acetylene black (AB) from Alfa Aesar (Johnson Matthey) and activated carbon cloth ACC-507-25 (2500 m2 g−1) from Kynol®. Acetonitrile (Fluka, >99.9%) was distilled through a Vigreoux column sieves. Propylene carbonate (PC, Merck) was distilled under reduced pressure. Both AN and PC were stored over A3 molecular sieves. The activated carbon cloth was dried before use at 180 °C for 24 h. N-methyl-N-propyl-piperidinium bromide (MPPipBr) was synthesised from N-methyl piperidine (Aldrich) and bromopropane (Aldrich) in chloroform. Obtained MPPipBr was purified by crystallization in 2-propanol (P.O.Ch., Poland) after addition of tetrahydrofurane (P.O.Ch., Poland). N-methyl-N-propyl-piperidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide (MrPipNTf2) was obtained from MPPipBr by metathesis with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide (LiNTf2, Fluka) in an aqueous solution. N-methyl-N-propylpyrroldinium bromide (MPPyrBr) was obtained from N-methylpyrrolidinium (Aldrich) and bromopropane (Aldrich) in acetonitrile.

#### 2.2. Measurements
Conductivity measurements of liquid electrolytes were performed in a glass cell (having thermostating jacket) with Pt working electrodes (cell constant 4.81 cm−1). Cyclic voltammetry curves were recorded with the μAutolab electrochemical system (EcoChemie, the Netherlands). The ACC/electrolyte/ACC coin-type two electrode, symmetric EDLC cells, were assembled from two ACC sheets (covered with acetylene black layer), separated by a Whatmann glassy-fiber GF/A separator, in an adapted 0.5″ Swagelok® connecting tube. Activated carbon cloth electrodes as well as the separator were soaked with the electrolyte in a dry argon atmosphere in a glove box. Capacitors were conditioned before measurements in a thermostatic chamber at 60 °C. Impedance spectra were taken with the Atlas 98 EII electrochemical system (Atlas-Sollich, Poland) in a frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz, potential perturbation of 10 mV. Before impedance measurements, each EDLC cell was galvanostatically charged/discharged 10 times (current 10 mA) and discharged before impedance spectra had been taken. Equivalent series resistance of capacitors was deduced from the deconvolution of impedance spectra (software package ZView, Scribner Co.). Galvanostatic charging/discharging experiments were conducted with the use of the ATLAS 0461MBI multichannel electrochemical system (Atlas-Sollich, Poland). Capacitances of the devices were calculated from the slope of charging/discharging curves.
