### Introduction
Electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) are electrochemical energy storage devices that store charge by electrosorption of ions at high surface area carbon electrodes [1]. Despite their high specific power and longevity, the widespread use of EDLCs is limited by the low specific energy, owing to the purely physical charge storage mechanism. Many efforts to increase the specific energy of supercapacitors have focused on novel materials and innovative cell design by introducing Faradaic charge transfer to the capacitive system [2]. These approaches include the decoration of high surface area carbons with thin layers of Faradaic material [3], [4], [5], the use of redox-active electrolytes [6], [7], [8], composite electrodes combining these two charge storage mechanisms [9], [10], [11], or the utilization of an asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor cell design [12], [13].  
双电层电容器（EDLC）是电化学能量存储设备，通过在高表面积碳电极上电吸附离子来存储电荷[1]。尽管具有高的比功率和长寿命，但由于纯物理电荷存储机制，EDLC的广泛使用受到低比能量的限制。通过将法拉第电荷转移引入电容系统，许多提高超级电容器比能量的努力都集中在新型材料和创新的电池设计上[2]。这些方法包括用法拉第材料薄层装饰高表面积碳[3]，[4]，[5]，使用氧化还原活性电解质[6]，[7]，[8]，复合电极这两个电荷存储机制[9]，[10]，[11]或非对称混合超级电容器单元设计的利用[12]，[13]。

Asymmetric hybrid supercapacitors (AHSCs) employ one electrode storing charge by Faradaic reactions and another by capacitive double-layer formation. The aim is to synergistically combine the merits of battery and supercapacitor technologies, to produce cells that show higher specific energy than supercapacitors and higher specific power and longevity than batteries [14]. The most common types use a Li-ion intercalating negative electrode material and an activated carbon positive electrode [14]. More recent studies also investigated sodium intercalating negative electrode materials, creating so-called sodium-ion capacitors [15], [16], [17]. Most commonly, the negative electrode of AHSCs shows a relatively constant operation potential at which intercalation occurs, whereas the positive electrode shows a linear, capacitor-like potential development. Consequently, the maximum cell voltage is determined by the difference between the intercalation potential of the negative electrode and the anodic stability limit of the electrolyte at the positive electrode.  
非对称混合超级电容器（AHSC）使用一个电极通过法拉第反应存储电荷，而另一电极通过电容双层形成。目的是协同结合电池和超级电容器技术的优点，以生产比超级电容器具有更高比能量，比电池具有更高比功率和寿命的电池[14]。最常见的类型使用嵌入锂离子的负极材料和活性炭正极[14]。最近的研究也研究了嵌入钠的负极材料，从而形成了所谓的钠离子电容器[15]，[16]，[17]。最常见的是，AHSC的负极​​显示出发生插入时相对恒定的工作电势，而正极则显示出线性的电容器状电势。因此，最大电池电压由负电极的嵌入电势与正电极处的电解质的阳极稳定性极限之间的差确定。

Using organic electrolytes like Li-ion containing acetonitrile or carbonate mixtures, the anodic limit at the positive electrode is mostly found at around 4 V vs. Li+/Li [18], [19], [20]. The most frequently chosen negative electrode material for AHSCs is graphite due to its low Li-ion intercalation potential of around 0.2 V vs. Li+/Li [18]. This low intercalation potential is beyond the stability boundary of most electrolytes and requires the formation of the so-called solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for stable cell operation [21]. Since SEI formation consumes Li-ions from the electrolyte, a prelithiation of the graphite electrode is required in a conventional AHSC cell due to the absence of a Li-containing positive electrode [18], [22]. Further, the SEI layer limits the power performance of the cell and can lead to dendrite formation at low operating temperatures or high charging rates [23]. The use of a negative electrode with a higher intercalation potential, like spinel lithium titanate (LTO, Li4Ti5O12), can effectively circumvent the necessity of SEI formation. Also, LTO is an attractive anode material for AHSCs because of its high rate capability, negligible volume change during intercalation and an intercalation potential of 1.55 V vs. Li/Li+ [24], [25], [26]. However, these advantages come at the cost of a drastic reduction of AHSC cell voltage to about 2.5 V in organic electrolytes (Fig. 1A), thereby exhibiting much smaller specific energies as comparable AHSCs using graphite as negative electrodes [18], [27].  
使用含有锂离子的乙腈或碳酸盐混合物的有机电解质，正极的阳极极限大多在相对于Li+/Li的4 V左右[18]，[19]，[20]。用于AHSC的最常选择的负极材料是石墨，这是因为其相对于Li+/Li的低锂离子嵌入电势约为0.2 V [18]。这种低的嵌入电势超出了大多数电解质的稳定性范围，并需要形成所谓的固体电解质中间相（SEI）才能使电池稳定运行[21]。由于SEI的形成会消耗电解质中的锂离子，因此，由于缺少含锂的正极[18]，[22]，在传统的AHSC电池中需要对石墨电极进行预锂化。此外，SEI层限制了电池的功率性能，并可能导致在低工作温度或高充电速率下形成枝晶[23]。使用尖晶石型钛酸锂（LTO，Li4Ti5O12）等具有较高插层电位的负极可以有效地规避SEI的形成。同样，LTO是AHSC的有吸引力的阳极材料，因为它的高倍率能力，插层过程中的体积变化可忽略不计，并且插层电势相对于Li/Li+为1.55 V [24]，[25]，[26]。然而，这些优势是以有机电解液中将AHSC电池电压急剧降低至约2.5 V（图1A）为代价的，因此与使用石墨作为负极的同类AHSC相比，其展现出的比能要小得多[18]，[27] 。

A well-known strategy to increase the specific energy of EDLCs is the use of ionic liquids (IL) as an electrolyte, as they offer larger stable potential windows compared to organic electrolytes [1], [14]. Furthermore, their non-flammability, low volatility, and broad liquid temperature range greatly enhance the safety of the respective devices [28], [29], and allow for stable cycling at elevated temperatures up to 100 °C [28], [30]. ILs have also been employed as battery electrolytes to capitalize on their distinct temperature and safety features. Therefore, they employ either an alkali metal electrode as ion-source [31] or a dissolved alkali salt [32], [33], [34].  
一种提高EDLC比能量的众所周知的策略是使用离子液体（IL）作为电解质，因为与有机电解质相比，离子液体（IL）提供了更大的稳定电势窗口[1]，[14]。此外，它们的不易燃性，低挥发性和宽广的液体温度范围大大增强了各个装置的安全性[28]，[29]，并允许在高达100 C的高温下稳定循环[28]，[30] ]。 IL也已被用作电池电解质，以利用其独特的温度和安全特性。因此，它们采用碱金属电极作为离子源[31]或溶解的碱金属盐[32]，[33]，[34]。

In this study, we employ such an IL electrolyte with dissolved alkali-ions for an AHSC with a negative intercalation electrode for the first time. By synergistically combining the distinct virtues of ILs, a significant advance to state-of-the-art AHSC technology is achieved: (1) The anodic stability at the positive electrode is expanded, thereby increasing the maximum accessible cell voltage and, in turn, the specific energy of the AHSC (Fig. 1A). (2) Higher operation temperatures are enabled, which is important to applications in the mobility sector where elevated temperatures are encountered. (3) The cell safety is improved because of the non-flammability and low vapor pressure of the ionic liquid. We explore this strategy for AHSCs, using a positive activated carbon electrode and a negative lithium titanate electrode. We demonstrate 4 V AHSC devices with high electrochemical cycling stability using both lithium- or sodium-containing ILs. These cells also function at an elevated temperature of 80 °C, which is the first report of the stable high-temperature operation of any AHSC device employing intercalation reactions. Our proof-of-concept study employs solely commercially available materials, underlining the possibility of straightforward application and large innovation potential of this cell concept by use of improved electrode materials or electrolyte mixtures.  
在这项研究首次采用这样的溶解碱离子的IL电解质，用于带有负插入电极的AHSC。我们首次将这种具有溶解碱离子的IL电解质用于带负插入电极的AHSC。通过协同结合IL的独特优点，可以实现先进的AHSC技术的重大进步：（1）扩大了正极的阳极稳定性，从而增加了最大可及电池电压，进而提高了AHSC的比能（图1A）。 （2）允许更高的工作温度，这对于遇到高温的移动部门的应用很重要。 （3）由于离子液体的不易燃性和低蒸气压，提高了电池的安全性。我们使用正极活性碳电极和负极钛酸锂电极探索AHSC的这种策略。我们展示了使用含锂或钠的离子液体具有高电化学循环稳定性的4 V AHSC器件。这些电池还可以在80°C的高温下运行，这是任何采用插层反应的AHSC装置在高温下稳定运行的第一份报告。我们的概念验证研究仅使用可商购的材料，强调了通过使用改良的电极材料或电解质混合物，这种电池概念可以直接应用并具有巨大的创新潜力。

Subsequently, the electrode slurry was doctor-bladed on a carbon-coated aluminum foil current collector (Ranafoil, Toyo Aluminium).

#### 2.3. Electrochemical characterization
All electrochemical measurements were conducted in custom-build three-electrode cells with a polyether ether ketone body and titanium pistons, more information on these cells is given in Ref. [35]. In half-cell measurements, 12 mm discs of AC or LTO were used as working electrodes and an at least 15-times mass-oversized activated carbon (type YP-80F, Kuraray, 5 mass% PTFE-bound) was used as a counter electrode. In full-cells, we used 12 mm discs of activated carbon and 10 mm discs of LTO. To achieve the exact mass ratio needed, small pieces of the 12 mm activated carbon electrodes were removed. As a quasi-reference electrode, activated carbon (type YP-50F, Kuraray, 5 mass% PTFE-bound) was used, which is highly reliable in ionic liquid electrolytes [36]. It was beneficial to use the same quasi-reference for all cells to provide easier comparability between lithium- and sodium-containing cells. The potential difference between the used YP-50F quasi-reference and metallic lithium is determined to 3.09 V. As current collector, we used 12 mm discs of carbon-coated aluminum foil (type EQ-CC-Al-18u-260, MTI Corporation) for all activated carbon electrodes and the separator was a 13 mm glass-fiber mat (GF/D, Whatman). After cell assembly, they were dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C overnight and transferred to an argon filled glovebox (MBraun, O2/H2O<1 ppm), where they were filled with electrolyte.

Electrochemical measurements were carried out with a potentiostat/galvanostat (VMP-300, Bio-Logic) in a climate chamber at 25 °C or at 80 °C. Galvanostatic charge/discharge experiments were carried out at varying specific currents between 10 mA/g and 2.5 A/g, with 10 s resting after each half-cycle. The values are normalized to the active electrode mass, i.e., neglecting the PTFE binder in AC electrodes and neglecting carbon black and PVDF binder in LTO electrodes. AC half-cells with Li-TFSI electrolyte were first cycled at 0.1 A/g from 0 V to 1.2 V, 1.4 V, 1.6 V, 1.8 V, and 2.0 V vs. carbon, each step for 5 times, before being cycled between 0 V and 2.0 V vs. carbon at varying rates between 0.1 A/g and 2.5 A/g, 5 times for each rate. LTO half-cells with Li-TFSI electrolyte were cycled from 0 V to −2.0 V vs. carbon at rates of 25 mA/g to 2.5 A/g, each step for 5 times, before being cycled for 200 times in the same range at 0.1 A/g. LTO half-cells with Na-TFSI electrolyte were cycled from 0 V to −2.4 V vs. carbon at rates of 10 mA/g to 1 A/g, each step for 5 times, before being cycled for 200 times in the same range at 0.1 A/g.  
用恒电位仪/恒电流仪（VMP-300，Bio-Logic）在25°C或80°C的气候室内进行电化学测量。恒电流充/放电实验是在10 specificmA/g和2.5 A/g之间的不同比电流下进行的，每个半周期后静置10s。将该值相对于活性电极质量进行归一化，即在交流电极中忽略PTFE粘合剂，在LTO电极中忽略炭黑和PVDF粘合剂。带有Li-TFSI电解质的交流半电池首先以0.1 A/g的速度从0 V循环到1.2 V，1.4 V，1.6 V，1.8 V和2.0 V（相对于碳），每个步骤进行5次，然后在相对于碳，0 V和2.0 V的变化速率介于0.1 A/g和2.5 A/g之间，每种速率5倍。含Li-TFSI电解质的LTO半电池相对于碳的循环速率从0 V到-2.0 V，以25 mA/g到2.5 A/g的速率循环，每步5次，然后在相同范围内循环200次在0.1 A/g。具有Na-TFSI电解质的LTO半电池相对于碳的循环速率从0 V到-2.4 V，以10 mA/g到1 A/g的速率循环，每步5次，然后在相同范围内循环200次在0.1 A/g。

The specific capacity Csp in all half-cells was calculated according to Eq. (1):$C_{sp} = \frac{\int_{t_0}^{t}I\, dx}{m}$ (1)
with current I, duration of the delithiation/desodiation/desorption step t-t0, and m the active electrode mass as defined above.

Li-AHSC cells were assembled with an AC:Li4Ti5O12 active mass ratio of 1.5:1. Galvanostatic cycling was carried out by charge/discharge at different rates between 10 mA/g to 1 A/g between 1 V and 4 V. Each charging/discharging step was repeated 5 times, with 10 s resting after each half-cycle. Na-AHSC cells employed an active mass ratio AC:Li4Ti5O12 of 1.2:1 and were cycled at the same rates as Li-AHSCs. Cycling stability was tested by galvanostatic cycling at 0.1 A/g for Na-AHSC cells and at 0.2 A/g for Li-AHSC cells, since they initially exhibited about the same specific energy at these rates. All normalizations are calculated with respect to the sum of active masses of both electrodes, i.e., of activated carbon and Li4Ti5O12 masses, excluding PTFE, PVDF and carbon black in the LTO electrode. The specific energy Esp of the cells was calculated by numeric integration according to Eq. (2):$E_{sp} = \frac{I \int_{t_0}^{t} U(t)\, dt}{M}$ (2)  
Li-AHSC电池以1.5：1的AC：Li4Ti5O12活性质量比组装。恒电流循环是通过在1 V和4 V之间以10 mA/g到1 A/g的不同速率进行充电/放电进行的，每个充电/放电步骤重复5次，每个半周期后保持10 s。 Na-AHSC电池的活性质量比AC：Li4Ti5O12为1.2：1，并以与Li-AHSCs相同的速率循环。通过恒电流循环测试Na-AHSC细胞的循环稳定性为0.1 testedA/g，而Li-AHSC细胞则为0.2 A/g，因为它们最初在这些速率下显示出大约相同的比能。关于两个电极的活性质量之和，即活性炭和Li4Ti5O12质量的总和，计算所有归一化，不包括LTO电极中的PTFE，PVDF和炭黑。通过根据等式的数值积分来计算电池的比能Esp。

The specific power was calculated by dividing Esp by the discharge time, the energy efficiency by dividing Esp by the energy spent in the charging step, and the Coulombic efficiency by dividing the charge delivered in the discharge step by the charge spent in the charging step.  
其中I是电流，U（t）是放电步骤中的电压曲线，t-t0是放电时间，M是两个电极的有效质量之和。通过将Esp除以放电时间来计算比功率，通过将Esp除以在充电步骤中花费的能量来计算能量效率，并且通过将在放电步骤中输送的电荷除以在充电步骤中所花费的电荷来计算库仑效率。

### 3. Results and discussion
#### 3.1. Lithium half-cells
Lithium-containing electrolytes were prepared by dissolving lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) in 1-methyl-1-propylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (PMPyrr-TFSI) to obtain 0.5 M and 1 M solutions. The anodic stability limits of the lithium-containing electrolytes with activated carbon electrodes (AC) were evaluated in a half-cell setup. The 1 M IL mixture still showed 90% Coulombic efficiency at 2.0 V vs. carbon (equal to 5.09 V vs. Li+/Li), which enables stable cycling for EDLCs [37], [38]. The potential profiles of AC in 1 M Li-TFSI electrolyte show a linear, capacitor-like behavior between 0 V and 2.0 V vs. carbon, with a capacity of around 80 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g (Fig. 1B). Further details of AC performance can be found in Supplemental Information (Fig. S2 and Fig. S3).  
将双（三氟甲基磺酰基）酰亚胺锂（Li-TFSI）溶解在1-甲基-1-丙基吡咯烷鎓双（三氟甲基磺酰基）酰亚胺（PMPyrr-TFSI）中，制得含锂的电解液，得到0.5μM和1μM的溶液。在半电池设置中评估了带有活性炭电极（AC）的含锂电解质的阳极稳定性极限。 1 M IL混合物在2.0 V相对于碳的情况下仍显示出90％的库仑效率（等于5.09 V相对于Li +/Li），这使得EDLC稳定循环[37]，[38]。 1 M Li-TFSI电解液中AC的电势曲线显示，相对于碳，在0 V和2.0 V之间呈线性，类似电容器的行为，在0.1 A/g时容量约为80 mAh/g（图1B）。交流性能的更多详细信息可以在补充信息中找到（图S2和图S3）。

LTO electrodes were employed and the lithium intercalation behavior was evaluated as a function of the Li-TFSI concentration. In 0.5 M Li-TFSI electrolyte, a maximum specific capacity of 138 mA h/g is measured at a rate of 25 mA/g and 81 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g (Fig. 1C). In 1 M Li-TFSI electrolyte, a similar maximum capacity of 143 mAh/g is exhibited, while the rate handling with 108 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g is far superior compared to 0.5 M Li-TFSI electrolyte (Fig. 1D, Fig. S4A). The hysteresis between lithiation and delithiation reactions is extremely narrow and remains below 100 mV at a rate of 25 mA/g. A narrow hysteresis is important to achieve high energy efficiency on an AHSC device level [39], [40]. Both electrolyte mixtures show a maximum capacity that is similar to comparable literature [41] and close to the theoretical capacity of LTO (175 mA h/g for fully lithiated Li7Ti5O12) [42] with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.0% at 25 mA/g, suggesting high compatibility of the IL electrolytes with LTO. The superior rate handling of 1 M Li-TFSI electrolyte implies that the Li-ion conductivity in the 1 M mixture is higher compared to 0.5 M. Higher Li-TFSI concentration increases the viscosity of the electrolyte mixture, leading to lower overall ion mobility. However, Li-ion mobility has a much greater impact on the rate performance of the LTO electrode. Further optimization work for the electrolyte formulation to achieve a perfect balance between general conductivity and Li-ion mobility, possibly with other ILs or mixtures thereof, should be conducted in the future. The cycling stability of LTO electrodes in 1 M Li-TFSI electrolyte was tested by galvanostatic cycling at 0.1 A/g (Fig. 1E). The shape of the voltage profiles remains unchanged, and the specific capacity only shows a minor fading from initially 108 mA h/g to 106 mA h/g after 200 cycles. The Coulombic efficiency remains at 99.8%, underlining high stability of the system in 1 M Li-TFSI electrolyte.  
使用LTO电极，并根据Li-TFSI浓度评估锂的嵌入行为。在0.5μMLi-TFSI电解液中，最大比容量为138μmA/h，在0.1μA/g的情况下测得的比容量为25μmA/g，81 mAh/g（图1C）。在1μMLi-TFSI电解液中，显示出相似的最大容量143 mAh/g，而在0.5μMLi-TFSI电解液中以0.1μA/g的108 mAh/g的速率处理要好得多（图1D，图S4A）。锂化和脱锂反应之间的磁滞非常狭窄，并且以25μmA/g的速率保持在100μmV以下。狭窄的磁滞对于实现AHSC设备级别的高能效很重要[39]，[40]。两种电解质混合物的最大容量都与可比文献[41]相似，并且接近LTO的理论容量（对于完全锂化的Li7Ti5O12，其理论容量为175 mA h/g）[42]，在25 mA/ g时的库仑效率高达99.0％。表明IL电解质与LTO具有高相容性。 1 M Li-TFSI电解液的优异速率处理意味着1 M混合物中的锂离子电导率高于0.5 M；较高的Li-TFSI浓度会增加电解液混合物的粘度，从而降低总体离子迁移率。但是，锂离子迁移率对LTO电极的倍率性能影响更大。将来应该对电解质配方进行进一步的优化工作，以实现一般电导率和锂离子迁移率之间的完美平衡，并可能与其他IL或其混合物一起使用。 LTO电极在1 M Li-TFSI电解液中的循环稳定性通过恒电流循环在0.1 A/g的条件下进行了测试（图1E）。电压曲线的形状保持不变，在200个循环后，比容量仅显示出从最初的108 mA h/g轻微下降到106 mA h/g。库仑效率保持在99.8％，这说明该系统在1 M Li-TFSI电解质中具有很高的稳定性。

To study the intercalation mechanism of lithium ions from the IL electrolyte, XRD measurements were conducted to compare a fully charged with a pristine LTO electrode (Fig. 1F). A comparison of both diffractograms reveals signals at identical positions, where spinel Li4Ti5O12 can be identified according to PDF 49–0207. LTO is known as a so-called zero-strain material, and the transformation from Li4Ti5O12 to Li7Ti5O12 during lithiation occurs with only 0.2% volume change [42]. Our XRD data with unchanged LTO peak positions and the straight voltage profile suggest that the lithiation mechanism does not change in Li-ion containing IL as compared to the conventional organic electrolytes. Undesired co-intercalation of IL cations into the LTO crystal structure is therefore unlikely.  
为了研究来自IL电解质的锂离子的嵌入机理，进行了XRD测量以比较完全充电的原始LTO电极（图1F）。两种衍射图的比较揭示了在相同位置的信号，可以根据PDF 49-0207确定尖晶石Li4Ti5O12。 LTO被称为所谓的零应变材料，在锂化过程中从Li4Ti5O12到Li7Ti5O12的转变仅发生0.2％的体积变化[42]。我们的XRD数据具有不变的LTO峰值位置和直线电压曲线，表明与传统有机电解质相比，锂的含锂离子的锂化机理没有改变。因此，不太可能将IL阳离子不希望地共嵌入LTO晶体结构中。

#### 3.2. Sodium half-cells
An emerging alternative to lithium-ion technology is the use of sodium-ion intercalating materials [43]. This motivated us to expand our AHSC cell concept to sodium-containing IL by replacing Li-TFSI with sodium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Na-TFSI). We use a 0.8 M solution of Na-TFSI in PMPyrr-TFSI, which we determined to be the maximum soluble Na-TFSI concentration in the IL at ambient conditions. LTO has been employed as anode material in sodium-ion batteries with organic carbonate electrolytes and showed a sodiation potential of around 0.9 V vs. Na+/Na [44], [45], [46]. This relatively high sodiation potential might circumvent SEI formation compared to other typical sodium-ion anode materials like hard carbon [47]. So far, sodium-ion intercalation in LTO from an IL electrolyte has not been reported. Using a 0.8 M Na-TFSI electrolyte, we observed an initial intercalation potential of around −2.0 V vs. carbon at a rate of 10 mA/g with a maximum specific capacity of 100 mAh/g, showing a relatively flat plateau and a first cycle Coulombic efficiency of 61.2% (Fig. 2A, Fig. S4B).  
锂离子技术的一种新兴替代方法是使用钠离子插层材料[43]。这促使我们通过用双（三氟甲基磺酰基）酰亚胺钠（Na-TFSI）代替Li-TFSI，将AHSC电池概念扩展到含钠IL。我们在PMPyrr-TFSI中使用0.8-M Na-TFSI溶液，我们确定这是环境条件下IL中最大的可溶性Na-TFSI浓度。 LTO已被用作带有有机碳酸盐电解质的钠离子电池的负极材料，相对于Na +/Na而言，其嵌钠电位约为0.9 V [44]，[45]，[46]。与其他典型的钠离子阳极材料（例如，硬碳）相比，这种相对较高的潜在氧化电位可能会阻止SEI的形成[47]。迄今为止，尚未报道过来自IL电解质的LTO中的钠离子嵌入。使用0.8μMNa-TFSI电解质，我们观察到初始插入电势相对于碳为-2.0μV左右，速率为10μmA/g，最大比容量为100mAh/g，显示出相对平坦的平台和第一个循环库仑效率为61.2％（图2A，图S4B）。

Sodium-ion intercalation in Li4Ti5O12 from organic electrolytes is expected to follow a three-phase mechanism with the formation of a lithium-rich phase Li7Ti5O12 and a sodium-rich phase Na6LiTi5O12 during sodiation [44]. Low efficiency in the first cycle is known from organic electrolytes and was linked to structural rearrangements of the LTO crystal structure [46], [48]. Over the next cycles, the onset of sodiation slightly shifts to a more positive potential of −1.85 V vs. carbon and the specific capacity increases, indicating that initial conditioning facilitates further sodiation reactions (Fig. 2A) [46]. The increased sodiation potential of the second cycle and subsequent cycles indicates the absence of SEI formation since the charge transfer resistance of the SEI would have shifted the sodiation towards more negative potentials. Rate handling tests at increased currents showed a capacity of 53 mA h/g at 0.1 A/g with a Coulombic efficiency of 98.5% (Fig. 2B). LTO showed stable cycling performance in the sodium-containing IL, exhibiting a slightly increased capacity of 54 mA h/g after 200 cycles at 0.1 A/g with a Coulombic efficiency over 98% (Fig. 2C).  
钠离子在有机电解质中嵌入Li4Ti5O12的过程预计会遵循三相机制，在电解过程中会形成富锂相Li7Ti5O12和富钠相Na6LiTi5O12 [44]。第一周期的低效率是从有机电解质中得知的，并且与LTO晶体结构的结构重排有关[46]，[48]。在接下来的循环中，相对于碳，开始形成的酸化作用略微转变为更正的电位-1.85 V，并且比容量增加，表明初始条件促进了进一步的酸化反应（图2A）[46]。第二个循环和随后的循环中增加的电化势表明没有SEI形成，因为SEI的电荷转移电阻会使电势向更负的电位移动。在增加电流下的速率处理测试显示，在0.1 A/g时容量为53 mA h/g，库仑效率为98.5％（图2B）。 LTO在含钠IL中显示出稳定的循环性能，在0.1μA/g的200个循环后，库仑效率略高于98％（图2C），显示出54μmA/h/g的容量略有增加。

We used XRD to examine the intercalation mechanism of sodium from IL electrolyte into LTO (Fig. 2D). The diffractogram of sodiated LTO confirms the formation of the sodium-rich Na6LiTi5O12 phase by broad reflections located at slightly lower 2θ than the Li4Ti5O12/Li7Ti5O12 signals. These shoulders are visible below the (111), (311), and (400) reflections at around 18.4°, 35.6°, and 43.2° 2θ, respectively. At the same time, the main reflections of the Li4Ti5O12/Li7Ti5O12 phase are observed, confirming the presence of at least two separate phases in the sodiated state. This behavior aligns with sodium-ion intercalation in LTO in organic electrolytes [44], [45] and shows that sodiation occurs according to the same mechanism for IL electrolyte.  
我们使用XRD研究了钠离子从IL电解质到LTO的嵌入机理（图2D）。钠化LTO的衍射图通过比Li4Ti5O12 /Li7Ti5O12信号略低的2θ处的宽反射确认了富钠Na6LiTi5O12相的形成。在（111），（311）和（400）反射下方分别在大约18.4°，35.6°和43.2°2θ处可见这些肩部。同时，观察到Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 /Li 7 Ti 5 O 12相的主反射，确认存在至少两个分离的相处于固溶状态。这种行为与有机电解质中LTO中钠离子的插入相吻合[44]，[45]，并表明根据IL电解质的相同机理发生了磺化反应。

#### 3.3. AHSC full-cells
AHSC full-cells were assembled with LTO as a negative electrode and activated carbon as a positive electrode. For AHSCs employing lithium intercalation (Li-AHSC), we chose 1 M Li-TFSI in PMPyrr-TFSI electrolyte, sodium-AHSCs (Na-AHSC) used 0.8 M Na-TFSI in PMPyrr-TFSI electrolyte. The voltage profile of a Li-AHSC cell cycled between 1.0 V and 4.0 V at 50 mA/g is shown in Fig. 3A. The cell exhibits very small overpotential of the lithiation reaction and efficient utilization of the charge distributed to the two electrodes, resulting in the high energy efficiency of 74%. This performance demonstrates that the promising electrochemical properties measured in half-cells can successfully be transferred to a Li-AHSC full cell employing IL electrolyte (further characterization in Supplemental Information, Fig. S6).  
以LTO为负极，活性炭为正极，组装AHSC全电池。对于采用锂插层（Li-AHSC）的AHSC，我们在PMPyrr-TFSI电解质中选择了1 M Li-TFSI，钠-AHSC（Na-AHSC）在PMPyrr-TFSI电解质中选择了0.8 M Na-TFSI。Li-AHSC电池在50 mA /g下在1.0 V和4.0 V之间循环的电压曲线如图3A所示。该电池表现出非常小的锂化反应超电势，并且有效利用了分配给两个电极的电荷，从而实现了74％的高能效。该性能表明，在半电池中测得的有希望的电化学性质可以成功地转移到采用IL电解质的Li-AHSC全电池中（补充信息中的进一步表征，图S6）。

In Fig. 3B, the voltage profile of a Na-AHSC cell cycled between 1.0 V and 4.0 V cell voltage range at 25 mA/g is provided, also showing a symmetric profile with high energy efficiency of 75%. In case of the Na-AHSC cell, special consideration has to be paid to the structural rearrangements in LTO during the first cycles (Fig. S6B). The irreversible charge consumed during this process at the negative electrode must be balanced at the positive activated carbon electrode. Therefore, in the following cycles, the maximum accessible potential window of 2 V vs. carbon is not fully used.  
在图3B中，提供了在25 mA /g的1.0 V和4.0 V电池电压范围之间循环的Na-AHSC电池的电压曲线，还显示了具有75％的高能量效率的对称曲线。对于Na-AHSC电池，在第一个循环中必须特别考虑LTO中的结构重排（图S6B）。在此过程中，负极上消耗的不可逆电荷必须在正极活性炭电极上平衡。因此，在接下来的循环中，相对于碳的2 V的最大可利用电势窗口并未得到充分利用。

We tested the galvanostatic cycling stability of Li-AHSCs between 1.0 V and 4.0 V cell voltage at a rate of 0.2 A/g (Fig. 3C). During the first cycles, a slight drop from about 36 W h/kg to 32.5 W h/kg is observed, before a continuing recovery over the next about 800 cycles back to 36 W h/kg is exhibited. The fluctuations during the first cycles are associated with common side-reactions, which originate from impurities of electrode materials or IL electrolyte, leading to shifting operation potentials of the electrodes relative to each other. The Li-AHSC cell provides performance stability over 1,500 cycles, with only minor fading to 32.9 W h/kg (91% retention). Cycling stability of the Na-AHSC cell (Fig. 3C) showed a significant increase in specific energy from about 35 W h/kg to 44 W h/kg during the first 50 cycles. Similar to half-cells, we expect the initial rearrangements inside the LTO particles during the three-phase intercalation reaction being the main cause for the increased capacity [46]. During subsequent cycles, the specific energy of Na-AHSC cells slowly decreases to about 24 W h/kg after 1,500 cycles, corresponding to a retention of 69% of the initial energy. The lower stability compared to Li-AHSCs can be related to the increased mechanical stresses during sodiation and desodiation, owing to the high ionic radius of sodium ions (1.06 Å) [49]. Considering the use of commercially available LTO particles as an electrode material, the observed stability of our novel cell concept is very promising. By use of further optimized electrode materials, for example, by use of nanohybrid electrode materials [4], [50], we expect a further improved stability.  
我们以0.2 A /g的速率测试了Li-AHSC在1.0 V和4.0 V电池电压之间的恒电流循环稳定性（图3C）。在第一个循环中，观察到从约36 W h /kg轻微下降到32.5 W h /kg，然后在接下来的约800个循环中继续恢复到36 W h /kg。在第一循环中的波动与常见的副反应有关，副反应源于电极材料或IL电解质的杂质，从而导致电极的操作电位彼此相对移动。 Li-AHSC电池可在1,500个循环中提供性能稳定性，仅轻微衰减至32.9 W h /kg（保留91％）。 Na-AHSC细胞的循环稳定性（图3C）显示，在前50个循环中，比能从大约35 W h /kg显着增加到44 W h /kg。类似于半电池，我们预计在三相插入反应过程中，LTO颗粒内部的初始重排是容量增加的主要原因[46]。在随后的循环中，Na-AHSC细胞的比能在1500个循环后缓慢降低至约24 W h /kg，相当于保留了初始能量的69％。由于钠离子的离子半径高（1.06Å），因此与Li-AHSC相比，稳定性较低的原因可能是其在糖化和脱泥过程中机械应力的增加[49]。考虑到使用市售的LTO颗粒作为电极材料，我们新颖的电池概念所观察到的稳定性非常有前途。通过使用进一步优化的电极材料，例如，通过使用纳米混合电极材料[4]，[50]，我们期望稳定性得到进一步改善。

The performance metrics of the AHSC cells are shown in a Ragone plot comparing specific energy and specific power (Fig. 3D), with the corresponding energy efficiency and Coulombic efficiency given in Fig. 3E. The specific energy of the Li-AHSC cell ranges from 98 W h/kg to 10 W h/kg at specific powers between 23 W/kg and 1.93 kW/kg. The Na-AHSC cell shows comparable results with a specific energy between 90 W h/kg and 5.4 Wh/kg at a specific power of 26 W/kg and 1.78 kW/kg. The corresponding energy efficiencies reach 78% with the most efficient operation of both devices at a current between 50 mA/g and 0.25 A/g, where Coulombic efficiencies are nearly 100%, demonstrating high reversibility. Comparison with the state-of-the-art literature on AHSCs using AC as a positive electrode and a titanate-based negative electrode with organic electrolytes, it is confirmed that our cell concept significantly increases the energy of devices using both lithium- or sodium-intercalation (Fig. 3D, Table 1) [17], [19], [51], [52]. We also provide a comparison using our Li-AHSC cell with 1 M LiClO4 in acetonitrile electrolyte (Fig. 3D, Fig. S7, Table 1). The specific energy can be increased by more than a factor of three by use of IL electrolytes compared to the same electrodes in an organic electrolyte. However, the rather large viscosity of IL electrolytes at room temperature limits the resulting power performance. A cell employing acetonitrile at room temperature can deliver higher power.  
AHSC电池的性能指标显示在Ragone图中，比较了比能量和比功率（图3D），图3E中给出了相应的能量效率和库仑效率。 Li-AHSC电池的比能量在23 W /kg和1.93 kW /kg之间的比功率下，从98 W h /kg到10 W h /kg。 Na-AHSC电池在90 comparableW /h /kg至5.4 Wh /kg的比能量和26 W /kg至1.78 kW /kg的比能量下显示出可比的结果。两种器件在50？mA /g至0.25？A /g的电流下最有效地工作时，相应的能量效率达到78％，库仑效率接近100％，表明具有高可逆性。与有关使用AC作为正极和基于钛酸酯的负极以及有机电解质的AHSC的最新文献进行比较，可以证实我们的电池概念显着提高了同时使用锂或钠电池的设备的能量插层（图3D，表1）[17]，[19]，[51]，[52]。我们还提供了使用我们的Li-AHSC电池与1 M LiClO4在乙腈电解质中的比较（图3D，图S7，表1）。与有机电解质中的相同电极相比，使用IL电解质可将比能提高三倍以上。然而，IL电解质在室温下的相当大的粘度限制了所得的功率性能。在室温下使用乙腈的电池可以提供更高的功率。

#### 3.4. High-temperature operation
IL electrolytes offer high safety because of their non-flammability and enable operation at elevated temperatures [53]. We demonstrate that these features can be transferred to our IL AHSC cell concept. Therefore, Li-AHSC cells are evaluated at a temperature of 80 °C. The power of the cells is highly increased because of the enhanced mobility of ions in the electrolyte. The voltage profile of a Li-AHSC cell cycled at 2.5 A/g is shown in Fig. 4A. With a limitation of the maximum cell voltage to 3.2 V, the positive electrode showed stable, linear potential development between 0 V and 1.2 V vs. carbon. At the same time, the negative LTO electrode showed relatively constant lithiation plateaus around −1.4 V vs. carbon. The latter value is 50 mV above the onset of lithiation at 25 °C, indicating a reduced barrier for intercalation at 80 °C (in agreement with Nernst equation). At this rate and temperature, the specific energy reached 37.5 W h/kg at a high specific power of 4.5 kW/kg, corresponding to a discharge time of 30 s, with an energy efficiency of 77.4% and Coulombic efficiency of 98.2% (Fig. 4A). Stability testing was carried out at the same rate and in the same voltage window for over 3000 cycles, with a retention of 80% of the initial value (Fig. 4B, Fig. S8A). When cycling at a lower rate of 0.1 A/g, the cell voltage is reduced to 2.8 V, resulting in a specific energy of 71 W h/kg at a power of 190 W/kg (Fig. S8B-C). To the best of our knowledge, no comparable hybrid supercapacitor cell that combines a Faradaic intercalation electrode with a capacitive electrode was shown to exhibit stable behavior at such a high temperature. The performance stability further underlines the promising performance of the Li-AHSC cell at elevated temperatures. By further improvement of the electrolyte formulation, for example, by creation of eutectic mixtures of ionic liquids [54], [55] or mixing with organic solvent [56], even low temperature operation could be enabled for this AHSC cell concept in the future.   
IL电解质由于不易燃，因此具有很高的安全性，并且可以在高温下运行[53]。我们证明了这些功能可以转移到我们的IL AHSC细胞概念中。因此，Li-AHSC电池在80°C的温度下进行评估。由于离子在电解质中的迁移率提高，因此电池的功率大大提高。 Li-AHSC电池以2.5A /g循环的电压曲线如图4A所示。将最大电池电压限制为3.2 V，相对于碳，正极在0 V至1.2 V之间显示出稳定的线性电势。同时，相对于碳，负LTO电极在-1.4 V附近显示出相对恒定的锂化平台。后者的值比25°C时锂化的开始时间高50µmV，表明在80°C时插层的势垒减小（与能斯特方程式一致）。在此速率和温度下，比能量为4.5 kW /kg的高比功率达到37.5 W h /kg，相当于放电时间为30 s，能量效率为77.4％，库仑效率为98.2％（图4A）。在相同的速率和相同的电压窗口中进行了超过3000个循环的稳定性测试，保留了初始值的80％（图4B，图S8A）。当以0.1 A /g的较低速率循环时，电池电压降至2.8 V，以190 W /kg的功率产生71 W h /kg的比能（图S8B-C）。据我们所知，尚无可比的混合法拉第超级电容器单元结合法拉第插层电极和电容性电极在如此高温下表现出稳定的性能。性能稳定性进一步强调了Li-AHSC电池在高温下的良好性能。通过进一步改进电解质配方，例如，通过创建离子液体的低共熔混合物[54]，[55]或与有机溶剂混合[56]，将来甚至可以在此AHSC电池概念中实现低温操作。

### 4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we prepared ionic liquid electrolytes with dissolved lithium- and sodium-salt, respectively, and applied them for the first time in an asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor cell employing ion intercalation at the negative electrode (LTO) and double-layer formation at the positive electrode (AC). After evaluation of half-cell performance, a successful transfer to full-cells was achieved and both the lithium- and the sodium-ion AHSC cells were operated at 4 V up to 1500 cycles with only minor capacity fading. The maximum specific energy of Li-AHSC cells was about 100 W h/kg, while the maximum specific power was about 2 kW/kg. Na-AHSC cells showed similar values with slightly reduced specific energy. Finally, Li-AHSC cells were shown for the first time to exhibit stable behavior at a high temperature of 80 °C for more than 3000 cycles at a high rate, exhibiting up to 38 Wh/kg at high power of 4.5 kW/kg.

We believe that the presented approach is particularly promising as it combines all virtues of ILs synergistically in one cell concept. ILs expand the stability window for the positive electrode, giving access to larger cell voltages, as we showed by enabling 4 V for LTO-based AHSC devices. The demonstrated possibility of high-temperature operation in combination with the non-flammability of the device is important for many applications including the mobility sector, where mass, volume, and cost of cooling systems and impact-safe housing could be reduced. The viability of this novel cell concept was demonstrated for different alkali ion systems by using only commercially available materials. Thus, there is great potential for further improvement, for example, by use of more advanced electrode materials that can increase energy, power, and longevity, or the exploration of further ILs or their mixtures with organic solvents or further additives.
