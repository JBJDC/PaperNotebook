### 1. Introduction
Ionic liquids (ILs) are molten salts with melting points at or below ambient temperature, and they have some unique properties, including good electrochemical and thermal stability, high ionic conductivity, non-volatility and nonflammability [1], [2]. Due to these properties, ILs have showed potential as safe electrolytes for being applied in high-energy-density lithium battery system, which uses lithium metal anode with high theoretical capacity (more than 3860 mAh g−1) [3], [4], [5], [6]. Furthermore, IL or IL-polymer electrolytes can obviously improve the performance of lithium battery using some cathode materials with high theoretical capacity (such as S [7], [8], NiS–Ni7S6 [9], V2O5 [10] and LiV3O8 [11]), owing to reduced dissolution of the active material into electrolytes compared with organic electrolytes.

The ILs, which have been used as electrolytes for lithium battery, can be classified into two categories according to their electrochemical stability. The first category contains tetraalkylammonium, pyrrolidinium, piperidinium and quaternary phosphonium ILs, which have better electrochemical stability and possess sufficiently lower cathodic limiting potentials to allow the deposition of lithium [12], [13], [14]. For example, N-methyl-N-propylpiperidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (PP13-TFSI) N-methyl-N-propylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (P13-FSI), N,N-diethyl-N-methyl-N-(2-methoxyethyl) ammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (DEME-TFSI) and triethyl(2-methoxyethyl) phosphonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (P222(2o1)-TFSI) have been reported to own good cycle performance when they are used in lithium battery at low rate without additives [3], [4], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. The second category includes imidazolium and guanidinium ILs, which have narrower electrochemical windows and higher cathodic limiting potentials compared with the first category. However, some ILs in the second category still have chances to be used in lithium battery successfully, because of the forming of good SEI (solid electrolyte interphase) film on lithium metal, which can restrain the reduction of IL electrolytes and allow the deposition of lithium. The electrolyte without additives based on 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (EMI-FSI) has been used in lithium battery [4]. The introduction of alkyl groups on the C-2 position of the imidazolium ring can improve the electrochemical stability of ILs [21], [22], and 1,2-dimethyl-3-propyl imidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (DMPIm-TFSI) electrolyte can be used in lithium battery without additives [23]. A series of guanidinium ILs based on small cations and TFSI anion have been synthesized by our group, and it has been found that two guanidinium ILs (1g13-TFSI and 1g22-TFSI), which have similar cathodic limiting potentials to the ILs based on EMI cation, can also be used as electrolytes for lithium battery without additives [24], [25].

Recently, eight functionalized guanidinium ILs based on small cations with ether group (methoxyethyl group, CH3OCH2CH2) or ester group (methyl acetate group) and TFSI anion have been prepared by our group [26]. In this study, one ether-functionalized guanidinium IL with low viscosity was used as new electrolyte for Li/LiCoO2 cell without additives, and the relationship between the electrolyte characteristics and the performances of Li/LiCoO2 cells were studied more detailedly. Viscosity, conductivity, behavior of lithium redox on Ni electrode and chemical stability against lithium metal, were investigated for the IL electrolytes with different concentrations of lithium salt. We examined the charge–discharge characteristics for the Li/LiCoO2 cells using the IL electrolytes, and estimated the activation energies of the LiCoO2 electrode for lithium intercalation by electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) method. And we found that, the cells had good capacity and cycle property at the current rate of 0.2 C when the LiTFSI concentration in the IL electrolyte was higher than 0.3 mol kg−1, and the cell using the IL electrolyte with 0.75 mol kg−1 LiTFSI owned good rate property.

### 2. Experimental
The structure of this functionalized guanidinium IL used in this study was shown in Fig. 1, and the IL was prepared according to our reported method [26]. The IL was dried under high vacuum for more than 24 h at 100 °C before using. The water content of the dried IL was detected by a moisture titrator (Metrohm 73KF coulometer) based on Karl–Fischer method, and the value was less than 50 ppm. Then five concentrations (0.3, 0.45, 0.6, 0.75 and 0.9 mol kg−1) of LiTFSI (kindly provided by Morita Chemical Industries Co., Ltd.), were added to the dried IL, respectively. And this procedure was carried out in an argon-filled glove box ([O2] < 1 ppm, [H2O] < 1 ppm).
