### Abstract
Paper-based supercapacitors (SCs), a novel and interesting group of flexible energy storage devices, are attracting more and more attention from both industry and academia. Cellulose papers with a unique porous bulk structure and rough and absorptive surface properties enable the construction of paper-based SCs with a reasonably good performance at a low price. The inexpensive and environmentally friendly nature of paper as well as simple fabrication techniques make paper-based SCs promising candidates for the future ‘green’ and ‘once-use-and-throw-away’ electronics. This review introduces the design, fabrication and applications of paper-based SCs, giving a comprehensive coverage of this interesting field. Challenges and future perspectives are also discussed.

### Introduction
Efficient energy production and storage in an eco-friendly and sustainable way has become a global objective.1 Novel energy storage methods are especially needed for the utilization of energy from renewable sources such as wind and solar where irregular electricity generation (great fluctuation and low efficiency) pose a great challenge for conventional electrical energy storage systems.2 A variety of energy storage technologies have been developed to meet this challenge, including mechanical, physical, thermal, chemical and electrochemical energy storage systems.3 Among these, batteries, (electrolytic) capacitors and supercapacitors, as three main groups of electrochemical energy storage devices, show great promise.4–7  
以生态友好和可持续的方式实现高效的能源生产和储存已成为全球目标.1特别需要新型能源储存方法来利用风能和太阳能等不可再生能源的能源，这些能源不规则发电（波动大，效率低）对传统的电能存储系统构成了巨大的挑战.2已经开发出各种能量存储技术来应对这一挑战，包括机械，物理，热，化学和电化学能量存储系统.3其中，电池，（电解）电容器和超级电容器作为三大类电化学储能装置，显示出巨大的希望

SCs (also known as electrochemical capacitors or ultracapacitors) hold an important and unique position that bridges the gap between conventional capacitors and batteries in terms of power density and energy density.8–11 The specific energy density of SCs is several orders of magnitude higher than that of conventional electrolytic capacitors. Although SCs possess a relatively low energy density with respect to batteries (e.g., lithium-ion batteries), SCs can store and deliver a large amount of charge in a very short period of time (in seconds), thus providing higher power density than batteries. SCs are widely applied in a variety of applications, including back-up power systems, load-leveling applications, electric vehicles and industrial energy management systems.12–16 Depending on the charge–discharge mechanism, SCs can be divided into electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs), where electrochemical energy is stored by ion adsorbing–dislodging (more like ideal capacitors), and pseudocapacitors, where energy is stored by fast surface redox reactions (more like batteries).17,18 EDLCs mainly utilize carbon materials (activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, graphene) as the electrode materials, while pseudocapacitors mostly use transition metal oxides and conducting polymers. Because of the different charge–discharge mechanism, EDLCs show high cycling stability and high power density but low capacitance and low energy density, whereas pseudocapacitors manifest the opposite performance. Hybrid SCs employ one EDLC type electrode and one pseudocapacitive electrode, combining the charge storage mechanism of both, so they are promising for demonstrating a high energy density, high power density as well as an excellent cycling stability.19  
SC（也称为电化学电容器或超级电容器）具有重要且独特的地位，在功率密度和能量密度方面弥合了传统电容器和电池之间的差距.8-11 SC的比能量密度比几个数量级高几个数量级。传统电解电容器。尽管SC相对于电池（例如，锂离子电池）具有相对低的能量密度，但SC可以在非常短的时间段（以秒为单位）存储和输送大量电荷，因此提供比电池更高的功率密度。 。 SC广泛应用于各种应用，包括备用电源系统，负载均衡应用，电动汽车和工业能源管理系统.12-16根据充放电机制，SC可分为双电层电容器（EDLCs），其中电化学能量通过离子吸附 -去除（更像是理想电容器）和赝电容器存储，其中能量通过快速表面氧化还原反应（更像电池）存储.17,18 EDLC主要利用碳材料（活性炭） ，碳纳米管，石墨烯）作为电极材料，而赝电容器大多使用过渡金属氧化物和导电聚合物。由于不同的充放电机制，EDLC显示出高循环稳定性和高功率密度但低电容和低能量密度，而赝电容器表现出相反的性能。混合SC使用一个EDLC型电极和一个赝电容电极，结合两者的电荷存储机制，因此它们有望展示出高能量密度，高功率密度以及出色的循环稳定性.19

Portable and flexible electronics require a new paradigm of energy storage systems that suits the requirement for flexibility. Flexible electronics is expected to bring us a variety of fancy applications: bendable cell phone, implantable heart sensor, flexible OLED (organic light emitting diode) display, etc.20 A flexible electronic device can still operate when bent, folded, compressed, or even stretched. The power source suitable for flexible electronics, accordingly, must be able to deliver a high enough power density and energy density under the above mentioned conditions. Due to the long lifespan compared to batteries and the high power performance, flexible SCs are especially important and thus receive a great deal of attention from both fundamental studies and technological applications.21–28 However, it remains a great challenge to fabricate flexible SCs that are inexpensive, flexible, light-weight and environmentally friendly. As with conventional SCs, further optimization of flexible SCs is mainly oriented toward improving the device's energy density through the design of new electrode materials,29,30 new electrolytes,31–34 and novel device architectures.35–37 Unique to flexible SCs, it is also crucial to search for and modify flexible substrates onto which flexible SCs can be built and integrated with energy generation devices or power outlets.  
便携式和柔性电子设备需要新的能量存储系统范例，以满足灵活性要求。灵活的电子产品有望为我们带来各种奇特的应用：可弯曲手机，植入式心脏传感器，柔性OLED（有机发光二极管）显示器等.20灵活的电子设备仍可在弯曲，折叠，压缩甚至弯曲时运行拉伸。因此，适合于柔性电子器件的电源必须能够在上述条件下提供足够高的功率密度和能量密度。由于与电池相比具有较长的使用寿命和高功率性能，灵活的SC特别重要，因此受到基础研究和技术应用的极大关注.21-28然而，制造灵活的SC仍然是一个巨大的挑战。价格低廉，灵活，重量轻，环保。与传统的SC一样，灵活SC的进一步优化主要是通过设计新的电极材料，29,30新电解质，31-34和新型器件架构来改善器件的能量密度.35-37灵活SC的独特之处，它对于搜索和修改柔性基板也是至关重要的，在该基板上可以构建灵活的SC并与能量产生装置或电源插座集成。

It is a rather interesting and imaginative idea that paper, a commodity ubiquitous in everyday life, instead of being the embodiment of human knowledge, can be exploited for future electronics in that it can be utilized as the substrate to build flexible SCs. The advantages are obvious: paper is truly a low-cost substrate compared with other flexible substrates such as PET (polyethylene terephthalate); paper is highly flexible as well as bendable; the process of making and disposing of paper is environmental-friendly; paper-based energy storage devices are necessary for all-paper electronics to operate.38–42 The inexpensive and environmental-friendly nature of paper enable some novel and interesting applications such as once-use-and-throw-away glucose sensors. Combined with the power of ‘printed electronics’, paper electronics seems promising as a forerunner of future electronics, in the sense that functional electronic devices are made in the way that people commonly think of as drawing pictures or printing newspapers.43–47 More importantly, to fabricate flexible SCs on paper represents the power of using logic to turn the negative into the positive. As paper is usually composed of cellulose fibers with a 3-dimensional hierarchical arrangement, the paper surface is not only very rough but also highly porous in comparison to common flexible substrates. The surface properties of papers may not be suitable for common electronic components such as conductive lines, diodes, capacitors, etc., but the porous and absorptive nature of paper is actually advantageous for some applications, such as for many energy devices in which large surface roughness is preferred. Especially, people can make full use of the nature of paper when the cellulose paper structure soaked with active materials is used in electrochemical energy storage devices such as SCs.  
这是一个相当有趣和富有想象力的想法，纸张是日常生活中无处不在的商品，而不是人类知识的体现，可以被用于未来的电子产品，因为它可以用作构建灵活SC的基础。优点显而易见：与其他柔性基材如PET（聚对苯二甲酸乙二醇酯）相比，纸张确实是一种低成本的基材;纸张具有高度的柔韧性和可弯曲性;制作和处理纸张的过程是环保的;基于纸张的储能设备是全纸电子设备运行所必需的.38-42纸张的廉价和环保特性使一些新颖和有趣的应用，如一次性使用和丢弃葡萄糖传感器。结合“印刷电子”的力量，纸质电子产品似乎有望成为未来电子产品的先驱，因为功能性电子设备的制造方式与人们通常认为的绘画或印刷报纸的方式相同.43-47更重要的是，在纸上制作灵活的SC表示使用逻辑将负面转化为正面的力量。由于纸通常由具有三维分层排列的纤维素纤维组成，因此与普通柔性基材相比，纸表面不仅非常粗糙而且具有高度多孔性。纸张的表面特性可能不适用于导电线，二极管，电容器等常见的电子元件，但纸张的多孔性和吸收性实际上对于某些应用是有利的，例如对于大表面的许多能量设备。粗糙度是优选的。特别是，当用活性材料浸泡的纤维素纸结构用于诸如SC的电化学储能装置时，人们可以充分利用纸的性质。

Paper-based SCs are based on the composite of conductive active materials with cellulose fibers, which comprise repeating cellobiose units with a high aspect ratio and the ability to form strong inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonds resulting in the fibers with hydroxyl-functionalized surfaces. These properties make cellulose fibers perfect structural units in conjunction with common conductive active materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs),38 graphene,48 polypyrroles (PPy),49 and polyanilines (PANI).50 Furthermore, cellulose fiber networks in a piece of paper can also provide pathways for ion transport.51  
纸基SC基于导电活性材料与纤维素纤维的复合物，其包含具有高纵横比的重复纤维二糖单元并且能够形成强的分子间和分子内氢键，从而导致具有羟基官能化表面的纤维。这些特性使纤维素纤维成为完美的结构单元，与常见的导电活性材料如碳纳米管（CNTs），38石墨烯，48聚吡咯（PPy），49和聚苯胺（PANI）相结合.50此外，纤维素纤维网络在一张纸上也可以为离子传输提供途径

It is worth noting that many so-called paper SCs in the literature actually do not involve paper at all in its literal sense; these so-called paper SCs are actually composed of free-standing electrodes that are made into a paper-like shape with no cellulose involved. These free-standing paper-like SCs will not be discussed in this review. One would refer to some reviews on this topic.10,52  
值得注意的是，文献中许多所谓的纸张SC实际上并不涉及纸张的字面意义;这些所谓的纸张SC实际上由独立电极组成，这些电极被制成纸状，不含纤维素。这篇独立式纸质SC将不会在本次审查中讨论。人们会参考有关该主题的一些评论.10,52

Although there are some excellent reviews in the field of flexible SCs, covering topics like all-solid-state flexible SCs,17,53 fiber SCs,36 and flexible SCs from various electrode materials’ perspectives,8,9,11,52,54–58 flexible SCs based on paper have seldom been touched upon.59,60 A review that covers all aspects of paper-based SCs is thus highly desirable to build a comprehensive overview and highlight the importance of this exciting direction. In this context, this review will first introduce the basics of paper SCs, i.e., the device structure and characterization methods of the electrochemical performance. Then, methods for fabricating paper SCs will be introduced, and recent developments of paper SCs will be discussed; lastly some concluding remarks will be presented to outline the challenges and future research directions in this exciting field.  
虽然灵活SC领域有一些优秀的评论，涵盖了各种电极材料的全固态柔性SC，17,53光纤SC，36和柔性SC等主题，8,9,11,52,54 -58基于纸张的灵活SC很少被涉及.59,60因此，非常需要一份涵盖纸质SC的所有方面的综述，以构建全面的概述并强调这一令人兴奋的方向的重要性。在这种情况下，本综述将首先介绍纸张SC的基础知识，即电化学性能的器件结构和表征方法。然后，将介绍制造纸张SC的方法，并将讨论纸张SC的最新发展;最后，将提出一些结论性意见，以概述这一令人兴奋的领域的挑战和未来的研究方向。  

### Performance evaluation for paper supercapacitors
```
The performance of a supercapacitor is usually reported in terms of their specific capacitance, energy density (energy stored per unit mass/length/area/volume) and power density (power unleashed per unit mass/length/area/volume). Although depending on the specific application and measurement technique, these parameters can be expressed in terms of gravimetric, volumetric and areal figures, for paper-based SCs, the specific capacitance, energy density and power density are usually expressed in areal terms. Electrode materials are often studied in a three-electrode electrochemical cell before being assembled into a two-electrode cell.61–63 The capacitance (C) and specific (areal) capacitance (CA) of each electrode in the three-electrode configuration are calculated from the cyclic voltammetric curves (CV) curves at different scan rates using the formula (1) and (2).  
超级电容器的性能通常根据其比电容，能量密度（每单位质量/长度/面积/体积存储的能量）和功率密度（每单位质量/长度/面积/体积释放的功率）来报告。尽管取决于具体的应用和测量技术，这些参数可以用重量，体积和面积数表示，对于纸基SC，比电容，能量密度和功率密度通常用面积表示。电极材料通常在组装成双电极电池之前在三电极电化学电池中进行研究.61-63计算三电极配置中每个电极的电容（C）和特定（面积）电容（CA）使用公式（1）和（2）从不同扫描速率下的循环伏安曲线（CV）曲线得到。  
C = (∫idV)/v(ΔV)	(1)  
CA = C/A	(2)  
where i (in amps, A) is the response current, V is the potential scan rate (V s−1), and ΔV is the applied potential region (in volts, V) and A refers to the area (cm2) of the electrode.  
其中i（以安培为单位，A）为响应电流，V为电位扫描速率（V s-1），ΔV为施加电位区域（以伏特为单位，V），A为区域（cm2）。电极。

For an assembled SC device, the capacitance (C) and areal capacitance (CA) of each device in the two-electrode configuration are calculated from the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves using formula (3) and (4)  
对于组装的SC器件，双电极配置中每个器件的电容（C）和面电容（CA）使用公式（3）和（4）从恒电流充放电曲线计算得出

C = i/(−dV/dt)	(3)  
CA = C/A	(4)  
where i (in amps, A) is the applied current, dV/dt is the slope of the discharge curve (in volts per second, V s−1), and A is the areal (cm2) of the device.  
其中i（安培数，A）是施加的电流，dV /dt是放电曲线的斜率（以伏/秒为单位，V s-1），A是器件的面积（cm2）。

The areal energy density (E) in W h cm−2 and power density (P) in W cm−2 derived from galvanostatic charge–discharge curves are calculated from formula (5) and (6), respectively.  
由恒电流充放电曲线得到的W h cm -2的面积能量密度（E）和W cm -2的功率密度（P）分别由式（5）和（6）计算。  
E = C(ΔE)2/(2A × 3600)	(5)  
where ΔE is the operating voltage window (measured in volts and obtained from the discharge curve excluding the voltage drop) and A refers to the total areal of the device.  
其中ΔE是工作电压窗口（以伏特为单位测量并从不包括电压降的放电曲线获得），A是指器件的总面积。  
P = ΔE2/(4RA)  
where R (=Vdrop/2i) is the internal resistance of the device that is estimated from the voltage drop (Vdrop) at the beginning of the discharge curve.  
其中R（= Vdrop /2i）是器件的内阻，它是根据放电曲线开始时的电压降（Vdrop）估算的。

One major problem when dealing with paper SCs and flexible SCs in general is the lack of standardized methods to evaluate and compare the device performance. Consequently, different reports are hard to compare and some results are misleading. For example, some reports use the mass of the active materials without the weight of the binder and carbon conductive additives instead of the whole electrode mass, and there is a great variation between different reports on the choice of length/area/volume of the electrode. It is recommended to calculate energy densities and power densities based on the total mass/area/volume of assembled SCs.53 It is a good practice to provide detailed information on the device, including the mass of the electrode, and the mass/thickness/area of the assembled devices. For paper-based SCs, the gravimetric figures are sometimes not so meaningful, whereas areal and volumetric figures are more useful. As discussed by Gogotsi and Simon,8 the gravimetric performance of the device is dependent on the thickness and density of the electrodes as well as the weight of the other components, which results in unreliable comparison of different SCs. Detailed discussion on the evaluation methods of SCs can be found in books and reviews.8,55,64–66  
处理纸质SC和灵活SC时的一个主要问题是缺乏评估和比较设备性能的标准化方法。因此，不同的报告难以比较，有些结果具有误导性。例如，一些报告使用活性材料的质量而没有粘合剂和碳导电添加剂的重量而不是整个电极质量，并且关于电极的长度/面积/体积的选择的不同报告之间存在很大差异。 。建议根据组装的SC的总质量/面积/体积计算能量密度和功率密度.53优良作法是提供有关设备的详细信息，包括电极质量和质量/厚度/组装设备的区域。对于基于纸张的SC，重量数字有时不那么有意义，而面积和体积数字更有用。正如Gogotsi和Simon所讨论的那样，8器件的重量特性取决于电极的厚度和密度以及其他元件的重量，这导致不同SC的不可靠比较。有关SCs评估方法的详细讨论可以在书籍和评论中找到.8,55,64-66

### Device structure of paper-based supercapacitors
The main components of a SC are the electrodes, electrolyte, current collectors and sometimes the separator. As with many solid-state flexible SCs, the polymer gel electrolyte film often acts as the separator. In the case of paper-based SCs, the electrodes are often conductive enough to take the role of the current collector as well. In this kind of SCs, the two main device configurations are the ‘in-plane’ device and the ‘sandwiched’ device. The corresponding device structures and mechanism are illustrated in Fig. 1.  
SC的主要组件是电极，电解质，集电器，有时是隔板。与许多固态柔性SC一样，聚合物凝胶电解质膜通常用作隔膜。在纸基SC的情况下，电极通常足够导电以起到集电器的作用。在这种SC中，两种主要的设备配置是“平面内”设备和“夹层”设备。相应的装置结构和机构如图1所示。
