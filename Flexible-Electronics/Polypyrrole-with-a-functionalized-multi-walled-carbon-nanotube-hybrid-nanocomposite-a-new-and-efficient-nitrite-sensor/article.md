### Abstract
This study mainly focuses on the electrochemical-assisted synthesis of conducting polymers such as polypyrrole (PPy) with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as a surfactant and supported with functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (f-MWCNTs). This nanohybrid composite was used as a nitrite sensor in aqueous medium. The co-deposition of f-MWCNTs into the polymer matrix was studied using scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and impedance analysis methods. The images obtained from the aforementioned techniques clearly revealed the incorporation of f-MWCNTs into the PPy/SDS matrix. The impedance values of the PPy/SDS/f-MWCNT composite films were found to be lower than those of pure PPy/SDS films. It was also observed that the capacitance of the PPy/SDS/f-MWCNT composite was found to be higher than the capacitance of the PPy/SDS composite. In addition, the capacitance of the composites gradually increased with respect to the increasing percentage of f-MWCNTs (from 0.1 to 0.3). The PPy/SDS/f-MWCNT composite-modified GCE exhibited a sensitive response to the electrochemical oxidation of nitrites. Under optimum conditions, the oxidation peak current of nitrites linearly increased with their concentration in the range from 3 μM to 1120 μM with the system exhibiting a lower detection limit (LOD) of 0.11 μM (110 nM) (S/N = 3). This LOD was much lower than the maximum admissible levels of nitrites in drinking water established by the European Community. Thus, the prepared hybrid composite may be a viable alternative as a highly selective sensor for the detection of nitrite ions present in real water bodies.  
这项研究主要集中在以导电十二烷基硫酸钠（SDS）为表面活性剂并以功能化的多壁碳纳米管（f-MWCNTs）为载体的聚吡咯（PPy）等导电聚合物的电化学辅助合成。该纳米复合材料用作水性介质中的亚硝酸盐传感器。使用扫描电子显微镜，原子力显微镜和阻抗分析方法研究了f-MWCNT在聚合物基体中的共沉积。从上述技术获得的图像清楚地表明，将f-MWCNT掺入了PPy /SDS基质中。发现PPy /SDS /f-MWCNT复合膜的阻抗值低于纯PPy /SDS膜的阻抗值。还观察到，发现PPy /SDS /f-MWCNT复合材料的电容高于PPy /SDS复合材料的电容。另外，随着f-MWCNTs百分比的增加（从0.1到0.3），复合材料的电容逐渐增加。 PPy /SDS /f-MWCNT复合改性的GCE对亚硝酸盐的电化学氧化表现出敏感的反应。在最佳条件下，亚硝酸盐的氧化峰电流随浓度在3μM至1120μM范围内线性增加，而系统的检测下限（LOD）为0.11μM（110 nM）（S /N = 3）。该LOD远低于欧洲共同体确定的饮用水中亚硝酸盐的最大允许含量。因此，制备的杂化复合材料作为检测真实水体中存在的亚硝酸根离子的高选择性传感器可能是可行的选择。


### 1. Introduction
Nitrites have been widely used as dyeing agents,1 bleaching agents,2 corrosion inhibitors3–5 and food additives6–9 in different industries. The importance of determination of nitrites in water, food and agricultural products has been recognized due to the evidence that nitrites can interact with amines and form carcinogenic compounds such as nitrosamines.10–12 Unfortunately, numerous studies have shown that nitrites are hazardous to human health because they can be converted into carcinogenic nitrosamines under the acidic conditions of the stomach.13 Moreover, nitrites can cause the removal of oxygen in the bloodstream after the catalytic oxidation of hemoglobin to methemoglobin.14,15 Hence, the detection of nitrite ions and the development of highly selective sensors have become important and inevitable. The European Community has established the maximum admissible levels of nitrites in drinking water as 0.1 mg L−1.16 Many methods for nitrite determination have been developed in recent years, for example, spectroscopy,17 chromatography,18 capillary electrophoresis, chemiluminescence,19 electrochemical methods,20etc. Among these, electrochemical techniques have advantages such as low cost, easy operation, high sensitivity and fast response for the determination of the nitrite concentration in aqueous solutions. Some of the electrochemical detection techniques are often employed for nitrite determination, e.g. potentiometry,21 voltammetry,22,23 amperometry,24,25etc.  
亚硝酸盐已在不同行业中广泛用作染色剂，1漂白剂，2缓蚀剂3-5和食品添加剂6-9。由于有证据表明亚硝酸盐可与胺相互作用并形成亚硝胺等致癌化合物，因此人们已经认识到测定水，食品和农产品中亚硝酸盐的重要性。10-12不幸的是，许多研究表明亚硝酸盐对人体健康有害因为它们可在胃的酸性条件下转化为致癌的亚硝胺。13此外，亚硝酸盐可在血红蛋白催化氧化为高铁血红蛋白后引起血液中氧气的去除。14,15因此，亚硝酸根离子和高选择性传感器的开发已经变得重要和不可避免。欧共体已将饮用水中亚硝酸盐的最高容许含量定为0.1 mg L-1.16。近年来，开发了许多亚硝酸盐测定方法，例如光谱法，17色谱法，18毛细管电泳，化学发光，19电化学方法， 20等其中，电化学技术具有成本低，操作简便，灵敏度高，测定水溶液中亚硝酸盐浓度响应快等优点。某些电化学检测技术常用于亚硝酸盐的测定，如电位法，21伏安法，22、23安培法，24、25等

The detection of nitrite ions using electro-oxidation of nitrite is more effective in deaerated solutions because the presence of molecular oxygen may limit the determination of nitrite.26,27 Although various modified electrodes show some improvement in nitrite determination compared with bare electrodes, these modified electrodes suffer from poor long-term stability and moreover the electrode surfaces cannot be renewed in case of contamination and passivation.28 Carbon composite electrodes have been widely utilized for the fabrication of electrochemical sensors in view of their low cost and easy fabrication. MWCNTs have attracted great attention in electroanalysis due to their unique properties, such as large surface specific area, good mechanical stability and high electronic conductivity.29 Moreover, MWCNTs can promote the electron transfer rate between electroactive species and electrodes.30 Therefore, MWCNTs could be used as a kind of robust and advanced carbon electrode material for the design of a nitrite sensing platform. Nowadays, modification and solubilization of MWCNTs are the developing research areas for many applications and several researchers have described the functionalization reactions. During functionalization of nanotubes (f-MWCNTs), bundles of nanotubes break or produce defects on the nanotube surface and shorten the nanotubes.  
在脱气溶液中使用亚硝酸盐的电氧化检测亚硝酸根离子更为有效，因为分子氧的存在可能会限制亚硝酸盐的测定。26,27尽管各种修饰电极与裸露电极相比在亚硝酸盐测定方面显示出一些改进，但这些修饰电极电极的长期稳定性差，而且在污染和钝化的情况下电极表面无法更新。28碳复合电极由于其低成本和易于制造而被广泛用于电化学传感器的制造。 MWCNT具有独特的特性，例如比表面积大，机械稳定性好和高电子传导性，因此在电分析领域引起了广泛关注。29此外，MWCNT可以促进电活性物质与电极之间的电子转移速率。30因此，用作亚硝酸盐感测平台设计的一种坚固耐用的碳电极材料。如今，多壁碳纳米管的改性和增溶是许多应用的发展研究领域，一些研究人员已经描述了官能化反应。在纳米管（f-MWCNT）的功能化过程中，纳米管束会在纳米管表面断裂或产生缺陷，并使纳米管变短。

Polypyrrole is one of the most commonly investigated intrinsic conducting polymers (ICPs), due to its unique properties such as high electrical conductivity, relatively good environmental stability and ease of preparation.31–34 In this work, we discuss on the electrochemical synthesis of PPy/SDS/f-MWCNT composite films using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and lithium perchlorate (LiClO4) as supporting electrolytes to increase the loading of the f-MWCNTs in the resulting composite films. Apart from improving the chemical affinity of f-MWCNTs towards polymer matrices, various modification strategies were adopted for effective processing to form PPy/SDS/f-MWCNT composites.  
聚吡咯由于其独特的特性（例如高电导率，相对良好的环境稳定性和易于制备）而成为最常研究的本征导电聚合物（ICPs）之一。31–34在本文中，我们讨论了PPy的电化学合成/SDS /f-MWCNT复合膜，使用十二烷基硫酸钠（SDS）和高氯酸锂（LiClO4）作为支持电解质，以增加所得复合膜中f-MWCNT的负载。除了提高f-MWCNTs对聚合物基体的化学亲和力外，还采用了各种改性策略来有效加工以形成PPy /SDS /f-MWCNT复合材料。

The majority of literature studies on the electrochemical capacitance have focused on the mass specific capacitance (CM, F g−1) of the electrode material. However, this work describes the electrode specific capacitance (CE, F cm−2), which can measure the practically achievable electrode capacitance against the geometric surface area of the current collector and serve this purpose very well.35 Finally, this work focuses on the characterisation of PPy/SDS/f-MWCNT composites and the development of nitrite sensors with high sensitivity and high selectivity using PPy/SDS/f-MWCNT composites. Finally, the proposed sensor was used to measure nitrate ions in tap water samples from Potheri village, Chennai, India.  
关于电化学电容的大多数文献研究都集中在电极材料的质量比电容（CM，F g-1）上。但是，这项工作描述了电极的比电容（CE，F cm-2），它可以针对集电器的几何表面积测量实际可达到的电极电容，并且非常有用。35最后，这项工作着重于PPy /SDS /f-MWCNT复合材料的表征和开发使用PPy /SDS /f-MWCNT复合材料的高灵敏度和高选择性的亚硝酸盐传感器。最后，该传感器被用于测量印度钦奈Potheri村自来水样品中的硝酸根离子。

Before the synthesis of the PPy/SDS/f-MWCNT composite, the MWCNTs were functionalised through acid treatment in order to disperse MWCNTs in an aqueous electrolyte. The raw MWCNTs were refluxed in 2.5 M HNO3 and 0.5 M H2SO4 at 100 °C for 6 h. Then the mixture was filtered and washed with deionized water until the pH of the mother liquor reached 7. The resulting material was dried overnight at 110 °C in a hot air oven.

##### 2.2.2. Electrodeposition of PPy/SDS/f-MWCNT composites by cyclic voltammetry (CV). 
The electrochemical polymerization of pyrrole was carried out using a CV method in aqueous solution containing 0.1 M pyrrole, 0.01 M SDS and 0.05 M LiClO4. The CV was carried out with the film that grew between −0.40 V and 0.75 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 for different cycles, such as 1, 3, 5 and 8 cycles, to control the thickness of the film. The electrochemical polymerization of pyrrole in the presence of f-MWCNTs was carried out for the synthesis of the PPy/SDS/f-MWCNT modified film on the GC electrode by the CV method in aqueous solution containing 0.1 M pyrrole, 0.01 M SDS (as a surfactant), 0.05 M LiClO4 (as a supporting electrolyte) and 0.2% of f-MWCNTs [previously f-MWCNTs were sonicated for 4 hours using a probe sonicator at 20 kHz]. The CV was carried out with the film that grew between −0.40 V and 0.75 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 for different cycles, such as 1, 3, 5 and 8 cycles, to control the thickness of the film.

#### 2.3. Electrochemical measurements of nitrites
To detect nitrite ions using PPy/SDS/f-MWCNT modified GCEs, a suitable sensing potential in the limit current plateau region was determined between −0.5 V and 1.2 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 using a CV method. A deaerated 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH = 7) was used for the measurement of nitrite ions. In order to determine the sensitivity and the detection limit of PPy/SDS/f-MWCNT modified GCEs towards nitrite anions using the DPV technique, oxidation current versus nitrite concentrations were recorded and the calibration curves were reported. Stock nitrite solution and phosphate buffer solutions were prepared with deionized water and the measurements were performed under a N2 atmosphere at 25 °C.

### 4. Conclusion
The PPy/SDS/f-MWCNT composite with different amounts (%) of f-MWCNTs, variations in thickness and different concentrations of SDS was synthesized and characterized for nitrite sensor application by the CV technique. Porous carbon nanotubes were modified with HNO3/H2SO4. During acid treatment, carboxylic (–COOH) and carboxylate groups (–COO−) were successfully grafted onto the MWCNT surfaces. The FT-IR results and dispersion properties of the acid treated MWCNTs in aqueous solution confirmed the formation of the functional groups on the outer surface of MWCNTs. The electrochemical properties and surface morphology of the composites were characterised by CV, SEM and AFM techniques, respectively. The PPy/SDS/f-MWCNT composite films have high specific capacitance and very low charge transfer resistance than the PPy/SDS film. The enhancement in the conductivity of the composite film due to the presence of f-MWCNTs was confirmed by impedance analysis. The nitrite electrochemical sensor showed a linear working range of 3–1120 μM, a detection limit of 110 nM (S/N = 3), and a correlation coefficient of 0.9925. The obtained electrochemical sensor exhibited high selectivity, high sensitivity (0.017 μA μM−1) and a very low detection limit than the earlier reported sensors. We consider that our proposed sensor holds abundant potential for the detection of nitrate ions in environmental water samples.
