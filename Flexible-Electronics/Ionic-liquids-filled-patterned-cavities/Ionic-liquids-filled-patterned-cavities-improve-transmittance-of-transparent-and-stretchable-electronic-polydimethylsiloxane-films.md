### Abstract
Transparent electrodes for flexible and wearable devices require considerable stretchability and patterned conductive materials. Transparent and stretchable polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films with patterned cavities were prepared by laser processing and transfer printing. Transparent conductive ionic liquids (ILs) and aqueous solution (AS) were injected into the cavities, obtaining electrodes with transmittance in the visible range of 99.94% (relative to blank PDMS films) and 92.80% (relative to air). This transmittance was almost identical to that of a blank PDMS film. The maximum tensile strain applied to the electrodes was 117.23%, and the resistance of the electrodes with network patterns measured by the four-probe method was 3.20 kΩ. After 10,000 stretching/releasing cycles under strain of 0–50%, these electrodes still performed optimally. The ILs and AS showed various transmittance and electrical properties. The electrodes with ILs had higher transmittance, while those with AS showed increased conductivity. These electrodes with five patterns (serpentine, circle, straight line, fold line, and rhombus) were analyzed. The pattern containing curves with a large curvature would result in a severe local stress concentration in the stretching process. Patterns containing parallel curves could optimize electrical conductivity. And patterns containing complex curves had a certain effect on the transmittance. In addition, taking advantage of the fact that the elastomer and the liquid can deform at will, these electrodes were used to fabricate two pressure sensors and two strain sensors, which were employed to demonstrate their sensitivity stability during cycling.  
用于柔性和可穿戴设备的透明电极需要相当大的可拉伸性和图案化导电材料。通过激光加工和转移印刷制备具有图案化空腔的透明且可拉伸的聚二甲基硅氧烷（PDMS）膜。将透明导电离子液体（IL）和水溶液（AS）注入空腔中，获得透射率在99.94％（相对于空白PDMS膜）和92.80％（相对于空气）的可见光范围内的电极。该透射率几乎与空白PDMS膜的透射率相同。施加到电极的最大拉伸应变为117.23％，通过四探针法测量的具有网络图案的电极的电阻为3.20kΩ。在0-50％的应变下进行10,000次拉伸/释放循环后，这些电极仍然表现最佳。 IL和AS显示出各种透射率和电性质。具有IL的电极具有较高的透射率，而具有AS的电极具有增加的电导率。分析了具有五种图案（蛇形，圆形，直线，折叠线和菱形）的这些电极。包含具有大曲率的曲线的图案将导致拉伸过程中的严重局部应力集中。包含平行曲线的图案可以优化导电性。含有复杂曲线的图案对透射率有一定影响。此外，利用弹性体和液体可随意变形的事实，这些电极用于制造两个压力传感器和两个应变传感器，用于证明它们在循环期间的灵敏度稳定性。

### Introduction
Stretchable and transparent electronic skin is characterized by strain and pressure sensitivity and has a broad application potential in touch sensors, energy-harvesting devices, heaters, triboelectric nanogenerators, neural circuits, electrochromic devices, and biomedical detection devices [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].  
可拉伸和透明的电子皮肤具有应变和压力敏感性，在触摸传感器，能量收集设备，加热器，摩擦纳米发电机，神经电路，电致变色设备和生物医学检测设备中具有广泛的应用潜力。

For the touch-sensitive layer of the photovoltaic energy-harvesting nanogenerator, transparency is considered a key feature to allow the photovoltaic cell to effectively harvest light [13]. High transparency will allow the sensory sheets to transmit electrical signals without impeding optical signals [14]. This property will enable optical stimulation, as well as continuous inspection of the surfaces covered by the sensory sheets. In addition, highly transparent and conductive monolayer electrodes in the biosensor enable it to be properly placed in a target position [15].  
对于光伏能量收集纳米发电机的触敏层，透明度被认为是允许光伏电池有效收获光的关键特征[13]。高透明度将使感官片能够在不妨碍光学信号的情况下传输电信号[14]。该特性将实现光学刺激，以及对感觉片覆盖的表面的连续检查。此外，生物传感器中的高透明和导电单层电极使其能够正确放置在目标位置[15]。

There has been considerable development of strain sensors based on solid materials for electronic skin. TiO2–Si films [16], zwitterionic nanocomposites [17], graphene [18], metal nanowires [19, 20, 21] and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [22, 23] are combined with elastomers and fabrics to produce multidimensional stretchable electronic skins, high tensile strain, and gauge factor. Strain sensors based on SiC [24] or ZnO nanofibers [25] can achieve minimum strain detection limits of 0.03%, but they are not transparent.  
基于用于电子皮肤的固体材料的应变传感器已经有了相当大的发展。 TiO2-Si薄膜[16]，两性离子纳米复合材料[17]，石墨烯[18]，金属纳米线[19,20,21]和碳纳米管（CNTs）[22,23]与弹性体和织物结合，生产出多维伸缩电子表皮，高拉伸应变和应变系数。基于SiC [24]或ZnO纳米纤维[25]的应变传感器可以达到0.03％的最小应变检测限，但它们不透明。

Pressure sensors based on nanofiber membranes [26] and sea urchin metal nanoparticles [27] show significant sensitivity (4.2 kPa−1), but they are not stretchable. Purpose-built structures, including nanostructured architectures [28] and coplanar-gate G transistors [29], can sense pressure, but have low light transmittance. Some novel materials, such as lead zirconate titanate and G nanoplatelets [30], acrylamide polyvinyl alcohol composites [31], and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) waveguide [32], exhibit low sensitivity when used as pressure sensors.  
基于纳米纤维膜[26]和海胆金属纳米粒子[27]的压力传感器显示出显着的灵敏度（4.2kPa-1），但它们不可拉伸。专用结构，包括纳米结构架构[28]和共面栅极G晶体管[29]，可以感应压力，但透光率低。一些新型材料，如锆钛酸铅和G纳米片[30]，丙烯酰胺聚乙烯醇复合材料[31]和聚二甲基硅氧烷（PDMS）波导[32]，在用作压力传感器时表现出低灵敏度。

Composites of polymers and emerging nanoinorganic conductive materials have been extensively developed in the last few years. The CNTs have been composited with polyvinylidene fluoride–hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP), PDMS, or acrylate rubber to achieve high tensile strain, which is limited by the low transmittance [33, 34]. Compositing reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with PDMS resulted in severe impairment of transmittance [35]. The composites of silver nanowires (AgNWs) and polyurethane–urea, Eco-flex, and island-based structure required vacuum operation and lithography to make the patterns [36, 37, 38]. All these inorganic materials, CNT, rGO, and AgNWs, are rigid and non-transparent, and stress concentrations occur on numerous locations during stretching. These problems have been solved in this study.  
近几年来，聚合物和新兴纳米无机导电材料的复合材料得到了广泛的发展。碳纳米管已经与聚偏二氟乙烯 -六氟丙烯（PVDF-HFP），PDMS或丙烯酸酯橡胶复合，以实现高拉伸应变，这受到低透射率的限制[33,34]。用PDMS复合还原的氧化石墨烯（rGO）导致严重的透射率损害[35]。银纳米线（AgNWs）和聚氨酯 -尿素，Eco-flex和岛基结构的复合材料需要真空操作和光刻来制作图案[36,37,38]。所有这些无机材料，CNT，rGO和AgNW都是刚性的和不透明的，并且在拉伸过程中在许多位置处发生应力集中。这项研究已经解决了这些问题。

Here, we report a highly stretchable transparent and patterned electronic skin using liquids as conducting carriers. Transparent conductive fluids have at least two advantages over opaque solid conductive materials. First, the conductive liquids are transparent, and therefore, the light transmittance of the prepared electronic skin can be extremely close to that of the transparent elastomer itself. Second, the conductive liquids can maintain a perfect match with the elastic matrix along with any deformation of the elastomer, whereas the intrinsic mechanical mismatch between the solid and matrix greatly limits the stretching properties [39, 40]. Since elastomers are omni-stretchable and omni-compressible, a strain- and pressure-sensitive electronic skin can be readily prepared. Accordingly, conductive and transparent ionic liquids (ILs) and aqueous solution (AS) were injected into the patterned cavities of transparent and stretchable PDMS films. In addition, the electrical and stretching properties of the electrodes were measured. Failure never occurred in over 10,000 stretching/releasing cycles. The stretchability and the transmittance of the five patterns, including serpentine, circle, straight line, fold line, and rhombus, were also studied. The patterned networks were found to reduce resistance by an order of magnitude. This paper focuses on the study of the sensitivity of the two pressure sensors and two strain sensors with straight-line networks and rhombus network patterns.  
在这里，我们报告了一种高度可拉伸的透明和图案化电子皮肤，使用液体作为导电载体。透明导电流体与不透明固体导电材料相比具有至少两个优点。首先，导电液体是透明的，因此，制备的电子皮肤的透光率可以非常接近透明弹性体本身的透光率。其次，导电液体可以与弹性基体保持完美匹配以及弹性体的任何变形，而固体和基体之间的固有机械失配极大地限制了拉伸性能[39,40]。由于弹性体是可全方位拉伸和全可压缩的，因此可以容易地制备对应变和压力敏感的电子皮肤。因此，将导电和透明离子液体（IL）和水溶液（AS）注入透明和可拉伸PDMS膜的图案化空腔中。另外，测量电极的电学和拉伸性能。超过10,000次拉伸/释放循环中从未发生过故障。还研究了五种图案的拉伸性和透射率，包括蛇形，圆形，直线，折叠线和菱形。发现图案化网络将电阻降低一个数量级。本文重点研究了两个压力传感器和两个应变传感器的灵敏度，这些传感器具有直线网络和菱形网络模式。

### Experimental
- *Materials*
PDMS, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sheet, AgNWs (200 μm diameter), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate, potassium chloride (KCl), anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), (KCl + Na2SO4)-saturated AS, and AgNO3 AS were obtained for these experiments.  
PDMS，聚氯乙烯（PVC）板，AgNW（直径200μm），1-丁基-3-甲基咪唑六氟磷酸盐，氯化钾（KCl），无水硫酸钠（Na2SO4），（KCl + Na2SO4） -饱和AS和AgNO3 AS。

- *Patterned cavities*
A 0.4-mm sheet of PVC was cut into the required pattern using an ultraviolet laser marking machine (HYM-05355A). The patterned PVC was then attached to another flat PVC sheet to create a pattern template. The liquid-cured PDMS was cast onto the template and sintered in a blast drying oven at 50 °C for 110 min. The 1-mm-thick PDMS film with patterned grooves was peeled off the template, and the transfer process was completed. The liquid PDMS was cast onto a flat blank PVC template and sintered at 50 °C for 70 min, to obtain a blank 2-mm-thick PDMS film with a sticky surface. The patterned PDMS substrate surface was coated with a small amount of curing agent and then covered with the flat PDMS film. The grooves were thus turned into cavities, and the entire piece was dried at 50 °C for 90 min to improve the consistency of the connection interface. The thickness of the entire film was 1.2 mm, and the cross-section size of the cavity was 0.8 × 0.4 mm.  
使用紫外激光打标机（HYM-05355A）将0.4mm的PVC片切割成所需的图案。然后将图案化的PVC连接到另一个平的PVC片材上以形成图案模板。将液体固化的PDMS浇铸到模板上，并在鼓风干燥箱中在50℃下烧结110分钟。将具有图案化凹槽的1mm厚的PDMS膜从模板上剥离，并完成转移过程。将液体PDMS浇铸到平坦的空白PVC模板上并在50℃下烧结70分钟，以获得具有粘性表面的空白2mm厚的PDMS膜。图案化的PDMS基底表面涂有少量固化剂，然后用平坦的PDMS膜覆盖。因此将凹槽变成空腔，并将整个部件在50℃下干燥90分钟以改善连接界面的一致性。整个膜的厚度为1.2mm，腔的截面尺寸为0.8×0.4mm。

- *Transparent electrodes*
Four AgNWs were placed at the end of the cavity and used as probes. The ILs or the AS was injected into the cavities, followed by sealing the injection ports with liquid PDMS. After the PDMS was cured, the patterned electrodes used in this study were fabricated.  
将四个AgNW放置在腔的末端并用作探针。将IL或AS注入空腔中，然后用液体PDMS密封注入口。在PDMS固化后，制造本研究中使用的图案化电极。

- *Characterization*
Current versus voltage curves were characterized with an electrochemical workstation. Optical transmittance was measured with a Shimadzu UV-1800 ultraviolet/visible/near-infrared (UV/VIS/NIR) spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). Tensile strains and stretching/releasing cycles were tested in a computer numerical control (CNC) screw slide rail, and the resistance was measured with a four-probe ET96 resistivity measurement system (East Changing Technologies, Inc., Beijing, China). Previous research used blank substrates for reference, and thus, blank PDMS films were employed as reference in this study. The reference film was obtained from the blank area of the sample to be tested, which reduced the effect that the thickness variation had on the transmittance test results. We also tested the transmittance of the samples using air as reference.  
用电化学工作站表征电流与电压曲线。用Shimadzu UV-1800紫外/可见/近红外（UV /VIS /NIR）分光光度计（Shimadzu Corp.，Kyoto，Japan）测量光学透射率。在计算机数控（CNC）螺杆滑轨中测试拉伸应变和拉伸/释放循环，并且用四探针ET96电阻率测量系统（East Changing Technologies，Inc.，Beijing，China）测量电阻。以前的研究使用空白基质作为参考，因此，在本研究中使用空白PDMS膜作为参考。从待测样品的空白区域获得参考膜，这降低了厚度变化对透射率测试结果的影响。我们还使用空气作为参考测试了样品的透射率。

### Results and Discussion
The fabrication process of the stretchable and transparent electrodes is shown in Fig. 1a. The liquid-cured PDMS was coated onto two types of templates, obtaining a PDMS film with patterned grooves and another blank flat film. The AS or ILs were injected into the cavities formed by the connection of these two films, and then the injection ports were sealed with liquid PDMS. With a blank 1.2-mm-thick PDMS film as the reference, the transmittance of this electrode was as high as 99.94%. The current versus voltage (C–V) curves of the (KCl + Na2SO4) AS, and ILs are shown in Fig. 1b, c, respectively. When the applied voltage reached 1 V, the current of the (KCl + Na2SO4) AS was 2.92 × 10−3 A, which is 56 times higher than the 5.19 × 10−5 A of ILs. As the conduction mechanism was not an ohmic contact, the two curves were not straight lines with a constant slope. The C–V curves of the AgNO3 AS at concentration of 1, 2, and 3 mol/L, are shown in Fig. 1d. Unlike the above two liquids, the C–V curve of this AS was almost a straight line with a constant slope because the conductive mechanism was the same as that of electroplating. When the applied voltage reached 1 V, the current was 1.98 × 10−2 A (1 mol/L), 2.79 × 10−2 A (2 mol/L), and 2.61 × 10−2 A (3 mol/L), an order of magnitude higher than that of the (KCl + Na2SO4) AS.  
可拉伸和透明电极的制造过程如图1a所示。将液体固化的PDMS涂覆到两种类型的模板上，获得具有图案化凹槽的PDMS膜和另一个空白平膜。将AS或IL注入通过这两个膜的连接形成的空腔中，然后用液体PDMS密封注入口。使用1.2mm厚的空白PDMS膜作为参考，该电极的透射率高达99.94％。 （KCl + Na2SO4）AS和ILs的电流 -电压（C-V）曲线分别如图1b，c所示。当施加的电压达到1V时，（KCl + Na2SO4）AS的电流为2.92×10-3A，这比ILs的5.19×10-5A高56倍。由于传导机制不是欧姆接触，两条曲线不是具有恒定斜率的直线。浓度为1,2和3mol /L的AgNO3 AS的C-V曲线显示在图1d中。与上述两种液体不同，该AS的C-V曲线几乎是一条具有恒定斜率的直线，因为导电机制与电镀相同。当施加的电压达到1 V时，电流为1.98×10-2 A（1 mol /L），2.79×10-2 A（2 mol /L）和2.61×10-2 A（3 mol /L） ，比（KCl + Na2SO4）AS高一个数量级。

The mechanical and electrical properties of these electrodes are listed in Table 1. All the five patterns withstood a tensile strain above 100%, demonstrating their great stretchability. Although the maximum strain of PDMS reached 340%, it was closely related to the temperature and the time parameters during the preparation process. Thus, the stretching properties deteriorated after more than 200 min of sintering. The resistance of the electrodes with ILs was significantly higher than that of the electrodes with AS, which is consistent with the data shown in Fig. 1b–d. The resistance of the electrode with the serpentine pattern was the highest among all the patterns due to a longer line length per unit area, whereas the circles exhibited better electrical properties.  
表1中列出了这些电极的机械和电气性能。所有五种图案都承受了超过100％的拉伸应变，表明它们具有很好的拉伸性。尽管PDMS的最大应变达到340％，但它与制备过程中的温度和时间参数密切相关。因此，在超过200分钟的烧结后，拉伸性能劣化。具有IL的电极的电阻显着高于具有AS的电极的电阻，这与图1b-d中所示的数据一致。由于每单位面积的线长度较长，所有图案中电极与蛇形图案的电阻最高，而圆圈表现出更好的电性能。

Pattern | Max strain | Resistance (ILs)/kΩ | Resistance (KCl + Na2SO4 AS)/kΩ | Resistance (AgNO3 AS)/kΩ
- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-:
Serpentine | 113% | 568 | 29 | 24
Circle | 101% | 210 | 12 | 12
Straight line | 114% | 248 | 28 | 13
Rhombus | 117.23% | 208 | 29 | 13
Fold line | 109% | 292 | 26 | 17

The optical transmittance of these stretchable and transparent electrodes is shown in Fig. 2. Specifically, Fig. 2a shows photographs of the 10 electrodes with two types of filling liquids and five patterns, which are given in Table 2. In the first photograph, for example, the cavity pattern of this electrode is serpentine and the filler is aqueous solution. The 10 photographs show no significant difference due to the nearly 100% optical transmittance. They appeared highly transparent and exhibited a clear background logo. With AS as the filling liquid, these patterns were vaguely visible, while with the ILs as the filler liquid, the patterns were invisible. The transmittance of the blank PDMS film with air as reference is shown in Fig. 2b. An increase in thickness caused a small decrease in transmittance. With a thickness of 1 mm, the transmittance was 93.91% at 700 nm and 92.38% at 400 nm, which was a 1.53% reduction as the wavelength decreased, indicating that the absorption of electromagnetic waves by the PDMS film increased with the increasing energy of the photons. As a result, the transmittance of the PDMS film gradually decreased in the near-ultraviolet region. With a thickness of 1.2 mm, the transmittance was 92.93% at 700 nm and 90.44% at 400 nm.  
这些可拉伸透明电极的光学透射率如图2所示。具体地说，图2a显示了具有两种填充液体和五种图案的10个电极的照片，在表2中给出。在第一张照片中，例如，该电极的空腔图案是蛇形的，填料是水溶液。由于几乎100％的光学透射率，10张照片显示没有显着差异。它们看起来高度透明，并展现出清晰的背景标志。使用AS作为填充液，这些图案模糊不清，而ILs作为填充液，图案是不可见的。以空气为参照的空白PDMS薄膜的透射率如图2b所示。厚度的增加导致透射率的小幅下降。厚度为1 mm时，700 nm处的透射率为93.91％，400 nm处的透射率为92.38％，随着波长的减小，透射率降低1.53％，表明PDMS膜对电磁波的吸收随着能量的增加而增加。光子。结果，PDMS膜的透射率在近紫外区域逐渐降低。厚度为1.2mm，透射率在700nm处为92.93％，在400nm处为90.44％。

The transmittance of the five patterns, with AS as the conductive filler, is shown in Fig. 2c, d. Using PDMS films with a thickness of 1.2 mm as a reference, their transmittance between a wavelength of 400–700 nm was greater than 97.46%, as shown in Fig. 2c. The transmittance of the electrodes with the serpentine pattern was 99.22% at a wavelength of 700 nm and 99.58% at 400 nm, and there was a 0.36% increase as the wavelength decreased from 700 to 400 nm, indicating that the absorption of high-energy photons by the electrode gradually decreased in the near-ultraviolet region.  
以AS作为导电填料的五种图案的透射率如图2c，d所示。使用厚度为1.2mm的PDMS膜作为参考，它们在400-700nm波长之间的透射率大于97.46％，如图2c所示。具有蛇形图案的电极的透射率在700nm的波长下为99.22％，在400nm下为99.58％，并且随着波长从700nm减小到400nm而增加了0.36％，表明高能量的吸收。电极的光子在近紫外区域逐渐减小。

When using air as reference, their transmittance between 400 and 700 nm was greater than 90.38%, as shown in Fig. 2d. The transmittance of the electrode with a straight-line pattern was 92.80% at a wavelength of 700 nm and 90.54% at 400 nm, a 2.4% reduction with the decrease in the wavelength, which was the opposite of the results obtained with PDMS as reference. The PDMS itself rather than the electrodes used in this study decreased the transmittance in the near-ultraviolet region. The electrode transmittance was extremely close to that of the blank PDMS film, revealing the remarkable contribution of the liquids to light transmittance.  
当使用空气作为参考时，它们在400和700nm之间的透射率大于90.38％，如图2d所示。具有直线图案的电极的透射率在700nm的波长下为92.80％，在400nm下为90.54％，随着波长的减小而减少2.4％，这与使用PDMS作为参考的结果相反。 。 PDMS本身而不是本研究中使用的电极降低了近紫外区域的透射率。电极透射率非常接近于空白PDMS膜的电极透射率，揭示了液体对透光率的显着贡献。

The transmittance values of the five electrodes with ILs as the conductive filler are shown in Figs. 2e, f. The 1.2-mm-thick PDMS films were used as reference, when transmittance at 400–700 nm was greater than 97.24%, as shown in Fig. 2e. The transmittance of electrodes with the fold-line pattern was 99.77% at a wavelength of 700 nm and 99.94% at 400 nm, which exhibited a 0.17% increase as the wavelength decreased. The transmittance of electrodes with ILs was slightly higher than that of the electrode with the AS. When using air as reference, their transmittance between 400 and 700 nm was greater than 90.32%, as shown in Fig. 2f.  
具有ILs作为导电填料的五个电极的透射率值示于图3和4中。 2e，f。当在400-700nm的透射率大于97.24％时，使用1.2mm厚的PDMS膜作为参考，如图2e所示。具有折线图案的电极的透射率在700nm的波长下为99.77％，在400nm下为99.94％，随着波长的减小呈现0.17％的增加。具有IL的电极的透射率略高于具有AS的电极的透射率。当使用空气作为参考时，它们在400和700nm之间的透射率大于90.32％，如图2f所示。

The transmittance of the electrodes with a straight-line pattern was 92.75% at 700 nm and 91.55% at 400 nm, which was a 1.3% reduction with the decrease in the wavelength. This decrease was due to the material of the PDMS substrate itself.  
具有直线图案的电极的透射率在700nm处为92.75％，在400nm处为91.55％，随着波长的减小而降低1.3％。这种减少是由于PDMS基底本身的材料。

In order to evaluate the stretching properties, the electrodes with two types of network patterns were studied, as shown in Fig. 3. The outer contour size of the pattern networks was 30 mm × 20 mm. The filler was a solution of AgNO3, and the four AgNW probes were connected to the resistivity test system. The calculation of the tensile strain (ε) is given by:
ε=(L−L0)/L0 (1) where L0 denotes the initial length of the sample, and L denotes the length after stretching.  
为了评估拉伸性能，研究了具有两种网络图案的电极，如图3所示。图案网络的外部轮廓尺寸为30mm×20mm。填料是AgNO3溶液，四个AgNW探针连接到电阻率测试系统。拉伸应变（ε）的计算由下式给出：
ε=（L-L0）/L0（1）其中L0表示样品的初始长度，L表示拉伸后的长度。

For the electrode with straight-line networks, the resistance as a function of the applied tensile strain is shown in Fig. 3a. The resistance increased monotonically and evenly from 4.63 to 9.49 kΩ when the strain increased from 0 to 87.97% and then fluctuated in the range from 15.22 to 20.20 kΩ, as the strain continued to increase. The fracture occurred when the strain reached 107.52%. In order to study the stretching properties during cycling, the resistance change after 10,000 stretching/releasing cycles under a strain of 0–50% was evaluated, as shown in Fig. 3b. The resistance increased slightly from 4.75 to 5.79 kΩ when the number of cycles increased from 0 to 5,000 and then rapidly increased by 217% to 18.36 kΩ after 10,000 cycles.  
对于具有直线网络的电极，作为所施加的拉伸应变的函数的电阻示于图3a中。当应变从0增加到87.97％时，电阻单调均匀地从4.63增加到9.49kΩ，然后随着应变的继续增加而在15.22到20.20kΩ范围内波动。当应变达到107.52％时发生断裂。为了研究循环过程中的拉伸性能，评估了在0-50％的应变下10,000次拉伸/释放循环后的电阻变化，如图3b所示。当循环次数从0增加到5,000时，电阻从4.75增加到5.79kΩ，然后在10,000次循环后迅速增加217％到18.36kΩ。

For the electrode with rhombus networks, the resistance versus the applied tensile strain is shown in Fig. 3c. The resistance increased monotonically and continuously from 5.02 to 11.84 kΩ when the strain increased from 0 to 104.00%, and then fluctuated in the range from 10.71 to 15.18 kΩ as the strain continued to increase. The fracture occurred when the strain reached 117.23%. The stretching properties during cycling are shown in Fig. 3d. Its resistance was initially 3.48 kΩ and fluctuated slightly in the range from 3.26 to 3.48 kΩ during 10,000 cycles, which was completely different from the straight-line network electrode. During stretching, the length of the cavity increased, and the sectional area simultaneously   decreased, causing a change in the position of the liquid and a change in the resistance [41].
对于具有菱形网络的电极，电阻与施加的拉伸应变的关系如图3c所示。当应变从0增加到104.00％时，电阻从5.02单调连续增加到11.84kΩ，然后随着应变的继续增加，电阻在10.71到15.18kΩ的范围内波动。当应变达到117.23％时发生断裂。循环期间的拉伸特性如图3d所示。它的电阻最初为3.48kΩ，在10,000次循环期间在3.26至3.48kΩ范围内略有波动，这与直线网络电极完全不同。在拉伸过程中，腔的长度增加，截面积同时减小，导致液体位置的变化和电阻的变化[41]。

The above results showed that the pattern (the structure) of the cavity plays a role in the stretchability, electrical resistance, stretching/releasing ability during cycling, and optical transmittance of the electronic skin in this study.  
上述结果表明，腔体的图案（结构）在本研究中的拉伸性，电阻，循环期间的拉伸/释放能力和电子皮肤的光学透射率中起作用。

The maximum tensile strain that the electrode can withstand is limited by the patterned cavity. Although the maximum strain is mainly determined by the stretching properties of the PDMS substrate, the in-plane cavity is actually a defect in the film. The defect causes local stress concentration and does not achieve the stretching ability (tensile strain of 340%) of defect-free PDMS. Due to the small cross-sectional dimension of the cavity, the maximum strain of the electrode exceeds 100%.  
电极可承受的最大拉伸应变受到图案化腔的限制。尽管最大应变主要由PDMS基板的拉伸性质决定，但是面内空腔实际上是膜中的缺陷。该缺陷导致局部应力集中，并且不能实现无缺陷PDMS的拉伸能力（拉伸应变为340％）。由于腔的横截面尺寸小，电极的最大应变超过100％。

The resistance is related to the design of the pattern. For the solid conductive materials, the electrical resistance depends on the resistivity, length, and cross-sectional area, and the formula is R = ρ(L/S). Moreover, the number of conductive paths in parallel connection has an effect on reducing the resistance. Even though the charge carriers of the conductive liquids are anions and cations rather than electrons, the electrical resistance still depends on these four influencing factors. For a serpentine pattern, the conductive path is only one and meanders, so the electrical resistance is always the largest regardless of the conductive liquid. Other patterns have parallel connection and shorter conductive paths, and the resistance is significantly lower than that of the serpentine. On the other hand, since the straight-line pattern is completely parallel to the stretching direction, its cross-sectional dimension is uniformly reduced upon stretching, thereby exhibiting a linear increased resistance with tensile strain (as shown in Fig. 3a).  
阻力与图案的设计有关。对于固体导电材料，电阻取决于电阻率，长度和横截面积，并且公式为R =ρ（L /S）。而且，并联连接的导电路径的数量对降低电阻有影响。即使导电液体的电荷载体是阴离子和阳离子而不是电子，电阻仍然取决于这四个影响因素。对于蛇形图案，导电路径只有一个并且曲折，因此无论导电液体如何，电阻总是最大的。其他图案具有并联连接和较短的导电路径，并且电阻显着低于蛇形的电阻。另一方面，由于直线图案与拉伸方向完全平行，因此其拉伸时的横截面尺寸均匀地减小，从而表现出拉伸应变的线性增加的阻力（如图3a所示）。

Distinct patterns show different ability to withstand the stretching/releasing cycles. Closed patterns, such as parallelograms and ellipses, can themselves undergo reproducible deformation during the stretching process. The applied strain is therefore primarily coordinated by the deformation of the pattern, and the patterned cavity is only subject to small strains and very low local stress concentrations, resulting in less damage and longer durability of the electrodes. For a cavity with a straight-line pattern, the strain can only be completely coordinated by itself, and as a result, the durability is not as good as that of the rhombus pattern.  
不同的图案显示出不同的承受拉伸/释放循环的能力。闭合图案，例如平行四边形和椭圆形，在拉伸过程中本身可以经历可再现的变形。因此，所施加的应变主要通过图案的变形来协调，并且图案化的空腔仅受到小的应变和非常低的局部应力集中，导致较少的损坏和较长的电极耐久性。对于具有直线图案的腔体，应变仅能够自身完全协调，结果，耐久性不如菱形图案的耐久性好。

Transmittance is affected by the patterned cavity and the composition of the conductive liquid. Since the PDMS substrate and the conductive liquid are both intrinsically transparent, the main factor affecting the transmittance is the reflection of the incident light on the surface of the cavity (the interface between the PDMS and liquids). In addition, the properties of the conductive liquid, including composition, viscosity, and wettability on the PDMS surface, can affect the reflection of light from the interface. Therefore, the transmittance of the electronic skin is slightly lower than that of PDMS films without cavity.
透射率受图案化空腔和导电液体的组成的影响。由于PDMS基板和导电液体都是固有透明的，因此影响透射率的主要因素是入射光在腔表面（PDMS和液体之间的界面）上的反射。另外，导电液体的性质，包括PDMS表面上的组成，粘度和润湿性，可以影响来自界面的光的反射。因此，电子皮肤的透射率略低于没有空腔的PDMS薄膜的透射率。

Additionally, two pressure sensors made with these transparent stretchable electrodes were shown to be due to the response to pressure, as shown in Fig. 4. Pressure sensors for electronic skin were attached to the back of the hand, and finger pressure caused changes in electrical resistance, as shown in Fig. 4a. Also, the pattern of the cavity had a certain degree of influence on the sensitivity. The change rate of the resistance (  R/R0 ) is given by: R/R0=(R−R0)/R0, (2) where R0 denotes the initial resistance, and R denotes the resistance under pressure.  
另外，用这些透明可拉伸电极制成的两个压力传感器显示是由于对压力的响应，如图4所示。电子皮肤的压力传感器连接到手背，手指压力导致电气变化阻力，如图4a所示。而且，腔的图案对灵敏度有一定程度的影响。电阻的变化率（R /R0）由下式给出：R /R0 =（R-R0）/R0，（2）其中R0表示初始电阻，R表示压力下的电阻。

Figure 4. Sensitivity of two pressure sensors a Sensors attached to the back of the hand can sense the applied pressure. For the pattern of straight-line networks, the applied pressure varying with time is shown in b, the corresponding resistance change rate is shown in c, and the effect of different pressures on the resistance change rate is shown in (d). For the pattern of rhombus networks, the applied pressure varying with time is shown in (e), the corresponding resistance change rate is shown in (f), and the effect of different pressures on the resistance change rate is shown in (g)  
图4.两个压力传感器的灵敏度附着在手背上的传感器可以感应施加的压力。对于直线网络的模式，施加的压力随时间变化如b所示，相应的电阻变化率用c表示，不同压力对电阻变化率的影响如（d）所示。对于菱形网络的模式，施加的压力随时间变化如（e）所示，相应的电阻变化率如（f）所示，不同压力对电阻变化率的影响如（g）所示。

When the pattern was a network of straight lines, the pressure applied to the sensor and the resistance change of the sensor are shown in Fig. 4b, c. The pressure was applied for six cycles, and the peak pressure was 120 kPa. The sensor responded accurately to the pressure, and the sensitivity (  R/R0 ) was from 2.13 to 2.44 at the pressure peaks. When the pressure was moved away, the change rate (  R/R0 ) was from 0.13 to 0.11, and the resistance was very close to the initial value (R0 = 6.40 kΩ). As the applied pressure varied, the sensor exhibited multiple amplitude responses, as shown in Fig. 4d. When the pressure was 34.32, 68.65, 102.52, 143.79 kPa, the sensitivity was 0.39, 0.63, 0.97, and 5.41, respectively. Evidently, when the pressure exceeded 102.52 kPa, the sensitivity rose sharply, and the gauge factor reached 0.02 kPa−1.  
当图案是直线网络时，施加到传感器的压力和传感器的电阻变化如图4b，c所示。施加压力六个循环，峰值压力为120kPa。传感器对压力做出准确响应，压力峰值时灵敏度（R /R0）为2.13至2.44。当压力移开时，变化率（R /R0）为0.13至0.11，电阻非常接近初始值（R0 =6.40kΩ）。当施加的压力变化时，传感器表现出多个幅度响应，如图4d所示。当压力为34.32,68.65,102.52,143.79kPa时，灵敏度分别为0.39,0.63,0.97和5.41。显然，当压力超过102.52 kPa时，灵敏度急剧上升，应变系数达到0.02 kPa-1。

For the pattern consisting of rhombus-shaped networks, the applied pressure and the resistance change of the sensor are shown in Fig. 4e, f. The pressure was applied for six cycles, and the peak was at 102 kPa. The sensitivity of the sensor was from 1.16 to 1.34 at the pressure peaks. When the pressure was moved away, the change rate (  R/R0 ) was from 0 to 0.15, and the resistance was close to the initial value (R0 = 3.20 kΩ). The multiple responses of the sensor to various pressures are shown in Fig. 4g. When the pressure was 34.32, 68.65, 102.52, and 143.79 kPa, the sensitivity was 0.08, 0.80, 1.00, and 2.53, respectively. Clearly, when the pressure exceeded 34.32 and 102.52 kPa, the sensitivity increased significantly. These findings proved that sensors with rhombus networks were approximately 40% less sensitive to pressure than those with straight-line networks.  
对于由菱形网络组成的图案，传感器的施加压力和电阻变化如图4e，f所示。施加压力六个循环，峰值为102kPa。压力峰值时传感器的灵敏度为1.16至1.34。当压力移开时，变化率（R /R0）为0至0.15，电阻接近初始值（R0 =3.20kΩ）。传感器对各种压力的多重响应如图4g所示。当压力为34.32,68.65,102.52和143.79kPa时，灵敏度分别为0.08,0.80,1.00和2.53。显然，当压力超过34.32和102.52 kPa时，灵敏度显着增加。这些研究结果证明，与直线网络相比，菱形网络传感器对压力的敏感度降低约40％。

In addition, two strain sensors with patterns of straight-line networks and rhombus networks were fabricated, as shown in Fig. 5. While subjecting to stretching/releasing and re-stretching cycles under strain of 0–50%, the resistance of the electrode as the strain sensor shows the increasing/decreasing and re-increasing cycles. When the network pattern was one of straight lines, the 50 tensile strain cycles applied with varying time were recorded and are shown in Fig. 5a, and the corresponding sensitivity of the resistance change is shown in Fig. 5b. The applied strain was increased and decreased at a constant rate of 8.18% per second, and, in total, 50 stretching/releasing cycles were performed. Similarly, this sensor responded for a total of 50 cycles, and the sensitivity under a 50% strain was 47%, with a gauge factor of 0.92. In each cycle, the resistance is minimum (wave trough) when the strain is 0 (ε = 0), and the resistance is maximum (wave crest) when the strain is 50% (ε = 50%).  
此外，制作了两个具有直线网络和菱形网络图案的应变传感器，如图5所示。在0-50％的应变下进行拉伸/释放和再拉伸循环时，电极的电阻因为应变传感器显示增加/减少和再增加循环。当网络图案是直线之一时，记录了施加不同时间的50个拉伸应变循环，如图5a所示，电阻变化的相应灵敏度如图5b所示。施加的应变以每秒8.18％的恒定速率增加和减少，并且总共进行50次拉伸/释放循环。类似地，该传感器总共响应50个循环，并且50％应变下的灵敏度为47％，应变系数为0.92。在每个循环中，当应变为0（ε= 0）时电阻最小（波谷），当应变为50％（ε= 50％）时电阻最大（波峰）。

Figure 5 Sensitivity of two strain sensors with patterns of straight-line networks and rhombus networks. The 50 tensile strain cycles applied with 0–50% varying time are shown in (a) and (b), and the corresponding sensitivity of resistance change is shown in (c) and (d)

When the pattern was a rhombus network, the 50 tensile strain cycles applied with varying time were recorded and are shown in Fig. 5c, and the corresponding sensitivity of the resistance change is shown in Fig. 5d. The applied strain was increased and decreased at a constant rate of 6.20% per second, and, in total, 50 stretching/releasing cycles were performed. Likewise, this sensor responded for a total of 50 cycles, and the sensitivity under a strain of 50% was 82% with a gauge factor of 1.64. Its sensitivity rose and fell synchronously with the increase and decrease in the applied strain.  
当图案是菱形网络时，记录施加不同时间的50个拉伸应变循环，如图5c所示，电阻变化的相应灵敏度如图5d所示。施加的应变以每秒6.20％的恒定速率增加和减少，并且总共进行50次拉伸/释放循环。同样，该传感器总共响应50个循环，50％应变下的灵敏度为82％，应变系数为1.64。其灵敏度随施加应变的增加和减少同步上升和下降。

By comparing Fig. 5b with d, it is found that the electrode with rhombus networks exhibits higher strain sensitivity. For both strain sensors, the maximum resistance always appears at the maximum strain of each cycle, while the minimum appears when the strain is 0. The difference between the 50 maxima and the 50 minima is similar, demonstrating the stable and cyclic sensitivity. This is where the strain sensor in this paper is superior to other works [16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24].  
通过比较图5b和d，发现具有菱形网络的电极表现出更高的应变灵敏度。对于两个应变传感器，最大电阻始终出现在每个周期的最大应变处，而最小电阻出现在应变为0时.50个最大值与50个最小值之间的差异相似，表明稳定和循环灵敏度。这就是本文中的应变传感器优于其他工作[16,18,19,21,22,23,24]。

A summary of the properties of the stretchable and transparent electrodes is given in Fig. 6, illustrating the highest optical transmittance and noticeable stretchability achieved in this work. The black pentacle represents the transmittance referenced to the air, which is higher than all the other works. The red pentacle gives the transmittance referenced to the PDMS substrate. Few works exhibit higher maximum tensile strain than the electrode in this job, which is caused by the elastomer substrate itself with better stretchable properties. Liquid metals, carbon nanotubes, and metal nanowires were used as conductive carriers in other works, which achieve the transparent properties by the large amounts of gaps between the conductive materials. Besides gaps, the transparent and conductive liquids can further improve the optical transmittance from 92% (Ref.7) to 99.94% in this work.  
图6给出了可拉伸和透明电极特性的总结，说明了在这项工作中实现的最高光学透射率和明显的拉伸性。黑色五角星代表以空气为基准的透射率，高于所有其他作品。红色五角星给出了以PDMS基底为参考的透射率。在这项工作中，很少有工件表现出比电极更高的最大拉伸应变，这是由弹性体基材本身具有更好的可拉伸性能引起的。液态金属，碳纳米管和金属纳米线在其他工作中用作导电载体，其通过导电材料之间的大量间隙实现透明性质。除了间隙之外，透明和导电液体还可以在这项工作中将光学透射率从92％（Ref.7）提高到99.94％。

### Conclusion
Transparent and conductive ILs and AS were injected into the patterned cavities of transparent and stretchable PDMS films. Flexible electrodes with ultra-high transmittance and great stretchability were successfully prepared. Five network patterns were fabricated by a laser processing and transfer printing process. The transmittance reached 99.94% with blank PDMS substrates as reference and 92.80% with air as reference. The stretching property was up to 117.23%, and the minimum resistance was 3.20 kΩ. These electrodes worked well after 10,000 stretching/releasing cycles under a strain of 0–50%. The electrodes with ILs exhibited higher transmittance, while those with AS were better conductors. The types of patterns contributed to the physical properties of the electrodes. The large curvature would result in a severe local stress concentration in the stretching process. Parallel curves could optimize electrical conductivity. And complex curves had a certain effect on the transmittance. The study of two pressure sensors and two strain sensors made with these electrodes with straight-line networks and rhombus network patterns demonstrated their stability of the sensitivity during cycling. These electrodes have multiple potential applications, such as in wearable electronic devices and biometric chips.
