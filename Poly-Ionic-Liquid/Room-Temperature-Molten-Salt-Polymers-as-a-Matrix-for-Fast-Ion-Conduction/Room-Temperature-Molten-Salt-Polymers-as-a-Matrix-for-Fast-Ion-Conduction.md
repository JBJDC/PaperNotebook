Vinyl polymers having either imidazolium group or sulfonamide group in the side chain were prepared as components to form a molten salt. After mixing, these polymers formed a molten-salt-like flexible domain in the polymer, and excellent ionic conductivity (7.52 X 10-6 Scm-l and 1.88 X 10 Scm-l at 30 oc, respectively) was observed in spite of their rubber- or powder-like properties.

Many types of solid polymer electrolytes have been investigated.] 3 However, fast lithium ion conduction is rather difficult because of strong ion-dipole interaction with ether oxygens4 in polyether derivatives which have been used as host materials so far. On the other hand, room temperature molten salts consisting of imidazolium derivatives5 '6 have recently been focused upon as potential electrolyte materials for power-storage devices78 because of preferable properties such as low vapor pressure, high ion contents, high matrix mobility at ambient temperature, etc. Such molten salts frequently called "organic ionic liquid systems' generally contain AIC13,9,10 and their instability toward moisture is still a serious drawback. On the other hand, when the counter anion of imidazolium was substituted for some organic anions, they were confirmed to form water-stable molten salts.5 Since there was a great improvement in the stability toward moisture, a detailed study of the nature of the imidazolium salt il for application to solar cells, 12 gel electrolytes, 13 and capacitors 14 has been carried out. Such molten salt systems suggested to us the possibility to provide a flexible and fast ion conduction path even in polymers. It was expected that the main chain part of a vinyl polymer would exibit good mechanical properties and both imidazolium salt and sulfonamide salt would provide an ion conducting path after molten salt formation. In the present paper, we prepared vinyl polymers having the imidazolium unit (I), and trifluoromethanesulfonamide unit (Il) as shown in Scheme I  
已经研究了许多类型的固体聚合物电解质。]然而，由于迄今为止已用作主体材料的聚醚衍生物中与醚氧4的强离子 -偶极相互作用，快速锂离子传导相当困难。另一方面，由咪唑鎓衍生物5'6组成的室温熔融盐最近作为用于蓄电装置78的潜在电解质材料而受到关注，因为其具有优选的性能，例如低蒸气压，高离子含量，环境温度下的高基质迁移率，这种通常被称为“有机离子液体体系”的熔盐通常含有AlCl3,9,10，它们对水分的不稳定性仍然是一个严重的缺点。另一方面，当咪唑的抗衡阴离子取代某些有机阴离子时，它们确认它们形成了水稳定的熔盐。由于对水分的稳定性有很大改善，因此详细研究了用于太阳能电池，12凝胶电解质，13和电容器14的咪唑鎓盐的性质。这种熔盐系统向我们提出了即使在聚合物中也能提供灵活快速的离子传导路径的可能性如果乙烯基聚合物的主链部分具有良好的机械性能，则咪唑鎓盐和磺酰胺盐将在熔盐形成后提供离子传导路径。在本文中，我们制备了具有咪唑单元（I）和三氟甲磺酰胺单元（II）的乙烯基聚合物，如方案I中所示。

Polymer I was prepared from I -vinylimidazole by reaction with bromoethane. The bromide ion in the compound obtained (lethyl-3-vinylimidazolium bromide: EtVyIm+Br) was exchanged for TFSI- (bis(trifluoromethanesulfonylimide) anion) via anion exchange reaction in an aqueous phase. The monomer EtVyIm+TFSI- has a very low Tg (-76.5 oc) and is liquid at room temperature. Polymerization of this monomer was initiated with azobisisobutyronitrile in degassed ethanol. Comparing ac ionic conductivity before and after polymerization, decreased ionic conductivity was observed as the result of polymerization (Figure l). I became rigid after polymerization, but it kept a low Tg (-75.4 oc). Due to the low Tg, TFSI- worked as carrier ions and a certain degree of ionic conductivity (about 10-7 Scm-l at 30 oc) was resultingly observed as shown in Figure I Ionic conductivity was improved by the addition of LiTFSI to this system. The effect of salt concentration on the ionic conductivity was studied in detail. When I was mixed with an equimolar amount of LiTFSI to the imidazolium unit, ionic conductivity was improved about 10 times (7.52 X 10-6 Scm-l at 30 oc) over the system without salt. Furthermore, the carrier ion species was confirmed by the lithium ion transference number  16 The tLi+ was very low at about 0.03 when I was mixed with LiTFSI in lower concentration (l : 10 to imidazolium unit). However, it increased to 0.68 at 50 oc when I was equimolarly mixed with LiTFSI. In the case of equimolar mixing of I with LiTFSI, the net lithium ion content was 33% of all mobile ions in the matrix, and thus this result indicated that Li moved faster than TFSI. In polyether derivatives, cations are known to migrate slower than anions, because the ion-dipole interaction act preferentially toward the cations. In constrast, such a constraining force acting only toward cations was not found in molten salts, and the relatively high tLi+ was observed for I. When the system contained an equimolar amount of LiTFSI, Tg was determined to be -47 oc. In the presence of ion-dipole interactions, the Tg of matrix is usually increased by the addition of salt. The introduction of a filnctional group, which can form molten-salt domain, was considerably effective for the dissolution of lithium salt without elevating the Tg.  
聚合物I由I-乙烯基咪唑通过与溴乙烷反应制备。通过阴离子交换反应在水相中将所得化合物中的溴离子（乙基-3-乙烯基咪唑鎓溴化物：EtVyIm + Br）换成TFSI-（双（三氟甲磺酰亚胺）阴离子）。单体EtVyIm + TFSI-具有非常低的Tg（-76.5α）并且在室温下是液体。用偶氮二异丁腈在脱气乙醇中引发该单体的聚合。比较聚合前后的离子电导率，作为聚合的结果观察到离子电导率降低（图1）。聚合后我变硬了，但保持低Tg（-75.4 oc）。由于Tg较低，TFSI-作为载体离子起作用，并且如图1所示观察到一定程度的离子电导率（在30℃时约10-7 Scm-1）。通过向其添加LiTFSI改善了离子电导率系统。详细研究了盐浓度对离子电导率的影响。当我将等摩尔量的LiTFSI与咪唑单元混合时，离子电导率比没有盐的体系提高约10倍（在30℃下为7.52×10 -6 Scm -1）。此外，载体离子种类通过锂离子迁移数16确认。当I与较低浓度的LiTFSI（1:10至咪唑单元）混合时，tLi +非常低，约为0.03。然而，当我与LiTFSI等摩尔混合时，它在50℃时增加到0.68。在I与LiTFSI等摩尔混合的情况下，净锂离子含量是基质中所有移动离子的33％，因此该结果表明Li比TFSI移动得更快。在聚醚衍生物中，已知阳离子比阴离子迁移得慢，因为离子-偶极相互作用优先作用于阳离子。相反，在熔融盐中未发现仅对阳离子起作用的这种约束力，并且在I中观察到相对高的tLi +。当系统含有等摩尔量的LiTFSI时，Tg确定为-47α。在存在离子 -偶极相互作用的情况下，通常通过添加盐来增加基质的Tg。引入可以形成熔盐区域的功能基团对于锂盐的溶解非常有效而不会提高Tg。

The combination of I and LiTFSI provided good lithium ion conductivity with high lithium transport number. The formation of a molten salt structure at the side chain of a vinyl polymer was effective for providing a fast ion conduction pathway. Another possibility existed to form a similar quasi-molten-salt domain in the side chain of a vinyl polymer. Polymer Il was prepared by the reaction of poly(allylamine) (Mw of 10,000) and CF3S02Cl in the presence of pyridine as a proton receptor. For the preparation, aqueous solution of poly(allylamine) was freeze dried (water content reached 0.3% after drying) and the reaction was carried out in DMSO. The reacted solution was purged in water to precipitate the polymer. This polymer was neutralized with lithium hydroxide in a mixed solvent of water and methanol. The ratio of substitution, i. e. , m/n was determined to be 0.114 by titration method. It appeared to be difficult to substitute all the amino groups in poly(allylamine). The polymer itself has very poor ionic conductivity; less than 10-9 at 50 oc because of both a relatively high Tg (-22.3 oc) and the absence of an ion conduction path. After mixing with diEIm+TFSI- (1,2dimethylimidazolium TFSI), the ionic conductivity of Il was greatly improved while maintaining its mechanical properties. When Il was mixed with an equimolar amount of salts to the sulfonamide group in Il (i. e. , to m), the Tg reached a minimum at -82.3 oc. This showed that the formation of a molten-saltlike-phase between 1m and sulfonamide was also effective to make a flexible ion conduction path. The ionic conductivity of Il jumped to 1.62 x 10-6 Scm-l upon addition of diEIm+TFSIequimolarly to the sulfonamide group (A) as shown in Figure 2. Further, the ionic conductivity of Il was improved 100 fold while maintaining its powder-like property (l .88 X 10-4 Scm-l at 30 DC) by adding excess diEIm+TFSI-. Even in the latter case, the concentration of lithium ion was still low, and high tLi+ was not obtained. A system consisting of Il with high m fraction should bring high lithium transport number and successive molten-salt domain. Preparation of this polymer system is under progress.  
I和LiTFSI的组合提供了良好的锂离子传导性和高的锂传输数。在乙烯基聚合物的侧链处形成熔融盐结构对于提供快速的离子传导途径是有效的。存在另一种可能性，即在乙烯基聚合物的侧链中形成类似的准熔盐结构域。聚合物II通过聚（烯丙胺）（Mw为10,000）和CF3SO2Cl在吡啶作为质子受体存在下反应制备。为了制备，将聚（烯丙胺）水溶液冷冻干燥（干燥后水含量达到0.3％）并且反应在DMSO中进行。将反应溶液在水中吹扫以沉淀聚合物。用氢氧化锂在水和甲醇的混合溶剂中中和该聚合物。替代率，即即通过滴定法测定m /n为0.114。似乎很难用聚（烯丙胺）中的所有氨基取代。聚合物本身具有非常差的离子导电性;由于相对较高的Tg（-22.3 oc）和不存在离子传导路径，因此在50 oc时小于10-9。在与diEIm + TFSI-（1,2-二甲基咪唑鎓TFSI）混合后，II的离子电导率得到极大改善，同时保持其机械性能。当Il与等摩尔量的盐与II中的磺酰胺基团混合时（即，至m），Tg在-82.3当量达到最小值。这表明在1m和磺酰胺之间形成熔融盐状相对于制备柔性离子传导路径也是有效的。如图2所示，在向磺酰胺基团（A）加入diEIm + TFSI等摩尔时，Il的离子电导率跃升至1.62×10 -6 Scm-1。此外，在保持其粉末的同时，II的离子电导率提高了100倍。通过添加过量的diEIm + TFSI-来测定性质（在1. DC时为1.88 X 10-4 Scm-1）。即使在后一种情况下，锂离子的浓度仍然很低，并且没有获得高的tLi +。由具有高m级分的II组成的系统应该带来高的锂转移数和连续的熔盐区。该聚合物体系的制备正在进行中。
