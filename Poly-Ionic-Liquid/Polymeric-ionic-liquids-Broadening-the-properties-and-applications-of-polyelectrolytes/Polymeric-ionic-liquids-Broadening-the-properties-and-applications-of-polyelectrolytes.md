### Abstract
The introduction of new ionic moieties, cations and anions, is extending the properties and classical applications of polyelectrolytes. These new polyelectrolytes are being named polymeric ionic liquids (PILs) in analogy to their monomeric constituents (i.e. cations such as imidazolium, pyridinium, pyrrolidonium and anions such as hexafluorophosphate, triflates, amidotriflates). This is giving rise to a new family of functional polymers with particular properties and new applications. The first part of this review will focus on the synthetic aspects of PILs and the main aspects related to their physico-chemical properties. In the second part we will review the new technological applications of these polymers such as polymer electrolytes in electrochemical devices, building blocks in materials science, nanocomposites, gas membranes, innovative anion sensitive materials, smart surfaces, and a countless set of applications in different fields such as energy, environment, optoelectronics, analytical chemistry, biotechnology or catalysis.

### Introduction
Ionic liquids (ILs) are generally defined as organic/inorganic salts with a melting point lower than 100 °C which present a good chemical and electrochemical stability, low flammability, negligible vapour pressure and high ionic conductivity. Although originally, most of the research and industrial activities related to ILs were associated to their applications in green chemistry [1] as substitutes of volatile organic solvents, ILs have been finding an increasing number of applications in other technological fields such as catalysis [2], organic and polymer chemistry, electrochemistry [3], [4], analytical chemistry [5], energy [6], nanotechnology [7] and biotechnology [8], among others. In the case of polymer science [9], ILs are being investigated as green solvents in polymerization processes [10], as specialty solvents of biopolymers like cellulose [11], as co-catalysts/initiators in polymerization reactions [12], [13], as specialty polymer additives and in the development of functional polymers [14], [15], [16]. Interestingly, functionalization of polymers having some of the chemical groups of ILs has been pursued as a way of developing a new class of polyelectrolytes which here we will name polymeric ionic liquids (PILs) also named in the scientific literature as poly(ionic liquid)s. It is the aim of this review to get a close and complete view to the synthetic methods, physico-chemical properties and technological applications of these new polymers.  
离子液体（ILs）通常定义为熔点低于100℃的有机/无机盐，其具有良好的化学和电化学稳定性，低可燃性，可忽略的蒸气压和高离子传导性。尽管最初，与IL相关的大多数研究和工业活动都与它们在绿色化学[1]中作为挥发性有机溶剂的替代品有关，但ILs已经在其他技术领域如催化中发现了越来越多的应用[2]。 ，有机和高分子化学，电化学[3]，[4]，分析化学[5]，能源[6]，纳米技术[7]和生物技术[8]等。在聚合物科学[9]的情况下，ILs正在作为聚合过程中的绿色溶剂[10]，作为生物聚合物如纤维素的特殊溶剂[11]，作为聚合反应中的助催化剂/引发剂[12]，[13]。 ]，作为特种聚合物添加剂和功能聚合物的开发[14]，[15]，[16]。有趣的是，已经开发了具有一些IL化学基团的聚合物的官能化作为开发新类型聚电解质的方式，在此我们将其称为聚合物离子液体（PIL），在科学文献中也称为聚（离子液体）。 。本综述的目的是对这些新聚合物的合成方法，物理化学性质和技术应用进行全面了解。

During the last few years, the introduction of the functional groups associated to ILs (i.e. cations such as imidazolium, pyrrolidonium, pyridinium and anions such as tetrafluoroborate, hexafluorophosphate, triflates) into functional polymers is giving rise to a new family of materials with particular properties and interesting applications. By looking at their chemical structure, PILs are polyelectrolytes, polymers whose repeating unit bear an electrolyte group (cation or anion). Although there is not a clear definition for PILs, we will consider those polymers synthesized from IL monomers in opposition to polyelectrolytes which are synthesized from solid salt monomers. PILs present some of the unique properties of ILs (ionic conductivity, thermal stability, tuneable solution properties and chemical stability) together with the intrinsic polymer properties. Contrary to classic polyelectrolytes which are water soluble and dissociate in aqueous solutions making the polymers charged (polysalts), most PILs are not soluble in water but in polar organic solvents. This is mainly due to the hydrophobic character of the counter-ion and the reduced columbic interactions. As illustrative examples, in the case of classic cationic polyelectrolytes the common counter-anions are halide anions such as Cl−, Br− or I−. However, typical counter-anions of PILs are hydrophobic anions such as tetrafluoroborate (BF4−), hexafluorophosphate (PF6−) or fluorinated amides ((CF3CF2SO2)2N− and (CF3SO2)2N−) (Fig. 1). In the case of conventional anionic polyelectrolytes, the common counter-cations are metallic cations such as Li+, Na+ or K+. However, typical counter-anions of PILs are organic cations such as dialkyl imidazolium, alkylpyridinium, tetraalkylammonium and alkylpyrrolidonium. Thus, as general trends, we can conclude that PILs are a class of polyelectrolytes synthesized from IL monomers which are not soluble in water but in organic solvents.  
在过去几年中，将与ILs相关的官能团（即咪唑鎓，吡咯鎓，吡啶鎓和阴离子如四氟硼酸盐，六氟磷酸盐，三氟甲磺酸盐等）引入功能性聚合物中，产生了具有特殊性能的新材料系列。和有趣的应用程序通过观察它们的化学结构，PIL是聚电解质，其重复单元带有电解质基团（阳离子或阴离子）的聚合物。虽然对于PIL没有明确的定义，但我们将考虑由IL单体合成的那些聚合物与由固体盐单体合成的聚电解质相反。 PIL具有IL的一些独特性质（离子电导率，热稳定性，可调溶液性质和化学稳定性）以及固有的聚合物性质。与经典的聚电解质相反，水溶性在水溶液中解离并使聚合物带电（聚合物），大多数PIL不溶于水但在极性有机溶剂中。这主要是由于反离子的疏水特性和降低的库仑相互作用。作为说明性实例，在经典阳离子聚电解质的情况下，常见的反阴离子是卤素阴离子，例如Cl-，Br-或I-。然而，PIL的典型反阴离子是疏水阴离子，例如四氟硼酸盐（BF4-），六氟磷酸盐（PF6-）或氟化酰胺（（CF3 CF2 SO2）2 N-和（CF3 SO2）2N-）（图1）。在常规阴离子聚电解质的情况下，常见的抗衡阳离子是金属阳离子，例如Li +，Na +或K +。然而，PIL的典型反阴离子是有机阳离子，例如二烷基咪唑鎓，烷基吡啶鎓，四烷基铵和烷基吡咯烷鎓。因此，作为一般趋势，我们可以得出结论，PIL是由IL单体合成的一类聚电解质，其不溶于水但是不溶于有机溶剂。

As in the case of polyelectrolytes, PILs can be classified as polycations bearing a cation in the backbone's part of the monomer unit, polyanions bearing an anion or polyzwitterions having both anion and cation. Furthermore, different types of copolymers (random, alternating, block) and macromolecular architectures such as branched, dendritic or ramified structures are potentially possible. This makes the number of PILs that can be synthesized extremely high due to all of the potential combinations between cations, anions and different polymer backbones and architectures. Thus, this review will only present the actual reported PILs and its applications which will be further developed in the future depending on the scientific curiosity of the scientists and the future technological interest on these functional polymers.  
与聚电解质的情况一样，PIL可以分类为在单体单元的主链部分中带有阳离子的聚阳离子，带有阴离子的多阴离子或具有阴离子和阳离子的多重两性离子。此外，不同类型的共聚物（无规，交替，嵌段）和大分子结构如分支，树枝状或分枝结构也是可能的。由于阳离子，阴离子和不同聚合物骨架和结构之间的所有潜在组合，这使得可以合成的PIL的数量极高。因此，本综述将仅介绍实际报告的PIL及其应用，这些将在未来进一步发展，这取决于科学家的科学好奇心和未来对这些功能聚合物的技术兴趣。

### Synthesis of polymeric ionic liquids 聚合离子液体的合成
Independent of their nature, there are two general approaches for synthesizing PILs as illustrated in Fig. 2 for vinyl imidazolium type polymers. It is worth to remember that the most characteristic chemical reaction in the synthesis of ILs consist of the methatesis or anion exchange of the halide anion in water driven by the liquid/liquid phase separation of the formed hydrophobic IL. Thus, the natural approach to PILs was pioneered by Ohno et al. which consisted in synthesizing a variety of IL monomers by anion exchange reaction of a cationic 1-vinyl-3-alkyl imidazolium halide type monomer with different counter-anions [17]. Then, the PILs were prepared by the direct polymerization of each different IL monomer (upper route). Alternatively, the second strategy consists of polymerizing first the imidazolium monomer and then carrying out the anion exchange reaction directly into a polyelectrolyte precursor, such as poly(1vinyl-3-alkyl imidazolium) chloride (lower route). In this case, the different PILs were obtained by precipitation in water of the solid PIL obtained after anion exchange of the halide anion by a more hydrophobic counter-anion [18]. Depending on the targeted PIL both methods can present some advantages/disadvantages. The first route involving the polymerization of IL monomers enables the preparation of homopolymers as well as copolymers. However this method involves a number of organic synthesis and purification steps at the monomer level as well as the need of controlling the polymerization conditions of each individual monomer. On the other hand, the second method is synthetically less complicated since it involves only one type of monomer purification and polymerization step, but it maybe somehow limited in cases where the anion exchange reaction is not quantitative, random copolymers or more complicated polymer architectures are searched.  
与其性质无关，有两种合成PIL的一般方法，如图2所示，用于乙烯基咪唑鎓型聚合物。值得记住的是，IL合成中最具特征的化学反应包括由形成的疏水性IL的液/液相分离驱动的水中卤化物阴离子的热解或阴离子交换。因此，Ohno等人开创了PIL的自然方法。其中包括通过阳离子交换反应合成各种IL单体，阳离子交换反应为阳离子1-乙烯基-3-烷基咪唑卤化物型单体与不同的反阴离子[17]。然后，通过每种不同IL单体的直接聚合制备PIL（上游途径）。或者，第二种策略包括首先聚合咪唑鎓单体，然后将阴离子交换反应直接进入聚电解质前体，例如聚（1乙烯基-3-烷基咪唑鎓）氯化物（下游路线）。在这种情况下，通过在更加疏水的反阴离子[18]的阴离子交换卤化物阴离子后获得的固体PIL在水中沉淀来获得不同的PIL。根据目标PIL，两种方法都可以带来一些优点/缺点。涉及IL单体聚合的第一种途径使得能够制备均聚物以及共聚物。然而，该方法涉及在单体水平上的许多有机合成和纯化步骤以及控制每种单体单体的聚合条件的需要。另一方面，第二种方法在综合上不太复杂，因为它只涉及一种类型的单体纯化和聚合步骤，但在阴离子交换反应不是定量，无规共聚物或更复杂的聚合物结构的情况下，它可能在某种程度上受到限制。
