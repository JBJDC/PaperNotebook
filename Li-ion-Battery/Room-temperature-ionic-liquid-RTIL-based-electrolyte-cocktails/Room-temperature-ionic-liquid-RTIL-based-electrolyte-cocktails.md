### Abstract
In this work, we report novel room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL)-based electrolytes to be used with high-energy cathode, lithium-rich nickel manganese cobalt oxide (Li[Li0.2Mn0.56Ni0.16Co0.08]O2, LiR-NMC) in Li-ion batteries. The physical and electrochemical characteristics of the newly developed materials are thoroughly detailed, also by means of post-cycling electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis of the resulting lab-scale lithium cells upon long-term, constant-current cycling (>1200 cycles). In addition, an innovative polymer electrolyte is developed encompassing the best performing RTIL-based electrolyte mixture, which is investigated in terms of its physico-chemical features, ion transport and electrochemical behaviour by EIS, cyclic voltammetry and constant-current (galvanostatic) cycling. The polymer electrolyte is obtained via facile, rapid and easily up-scalable UV-induced free radical polymerization (UV curing) technique, being a low-cost and solvent-free approach compared to other existing film formation techniques. The versatile fabrication method along with the use of appropriate materials may turn high-voltage, solid state and ageing resistant batteries into industrial reality in the coming years, as underlined by the excellent electrochemical response of the lithium polymer cell.

### 1. Introduction
During the past 25 years, after the market introduction of the 18650 cell by SONY in 1991, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have evolved rapidly (e.g., the energy density content has more than doubled) and adapted in many sizes and shapes, which allowed portable electronic devices to astonishingly boost their performances. The next development step is the large-scale penetration of such compact, high-energy storage systems into the huge market of hybrid- and full-electric vehicles (HEVs and EVs) [[1], [2], [3]]. It is vital to understand that future advancements in LIB performance are possible only through the selective use of new materials as innovative electrodes and electrolytes [4], and thorough investigation to overcome the problems. In recent years, improvements in cell chemistry included the development of nanostructured positive electrode materials with high operating potential [5,6], nanosized negative electrode materials with high capacity also operating at high current [7], novel electrolytes, electrolyte additives [8,9], and surface treatments or special foundations for packaging, e.g., integrated HF protection layer between the Al and the inner layer of the pouch envelop [10].  
在过去的25年中，在索尼于1991年推出18650电池后，锂离子电池（LIBs）迅速发展（例如，能量密度含量增加了一倍以上），并且适用于多种尺寸和形状，允许便携式电子设备惊人地提升他们的表现。下一个发展步骤是将这种紧凑的高能量存储系统大规模渗透到混合动力和全电动汽车（HEV和EV）的巨大市场[[1]，[2]，[3]]。至关重要的是要了解LIB性能的未来发展只有通过选择性地使用新材料作为创新电极和电解质才能实现[4]，并通过彻底调查来克服这些问题。近年来，细胞化学的改进包括开发具有高操作潜力的纳米结构正电极材料[5,6]，具有高电容的纳米尺寸负电极材料也在高电流下工作[7]，新型电解质，电解质添加剂[8， 9]，以及用于包装的表面处理或特殊基础，例如，在Al和袋子内包层之间的集成HF保护层[10]。

The development of innovative, low-cost and environmentally friendly nanostructured cathode materials, which can be used for persistent and stable operation upon large temperature gradients at high operative potentials, is another fundamental requirement to overcome the agreed strategic target fixed by the European Commission in Key Action 7 of the SET Plan (i.e., 350 Wh kg−1 at cell level by 2020). LiCoO2, the standard cathode material for 25 years [11], has relatively high cost and low abundance, which, together with its toxicity and safety issues, do not allow its use in large-scale devices for electric transportation and stationary storage. Therefore, nanostructured positive electrode materials with enhanced capacity, low-cost, long cycle life and good safety characteristics are being sought after. Recently, lithium-rich layered oxides having lithium ions intercalated into transition metal sites have attracted much attention [[12], [13], [14]], particularly the Li[NiMnCo]O2 based (Li-rich NMC) system due to its high operating potential exceeding 4.8 V vs. Li and very high practical discharge capacity values of around 240 mAh g−1 [15].  
开发创新，低成本和环保的纳米结构阴极材料，可用于在高工作电位下的大温度梯度下持续稳定运行，是克服欧盟委员会在Key确定的商定战略目标的另一个基本要求SET计划的行动7（即到2020年350Wh kg-1at细胞水平）。 LiCoO2，标准阴极材料25年[11]，具有相对较高的成本和较低的丰度，加上其毒性和安全性问题，不允许将其用于大型电气运输和固定存储设备。因此，正在寻求具有增强的容量，低成本，长循环寿命和良好安全特性的纳米结构正极材料。最近，锂离子嵌入过渡金属位点的富锂层状氧化物引起了人们的广泛关注[[12]，[13]，[14]]，尤其是Li [NiMnCo] O2基（富锂NMC）体系其高工作电位相对于Li超过4.8V，实际放电容量值非常高，约为240 mAh g-1 [15]。

Although its role is often considered trivial, finding a suitable electrolyte, which commonly refers to a solution comprised of salts and solvents, is a key-component to produce long-lasting LIBs. In fact, the development of suitable electrolyte systems is presumably the most fundamental threshold to overcome the occurring ageing phenomena and attain the necessary requirements in terms of safety (viz. non-flammability, stability upon long-term cycling as well as severe stressing operation at very high/low temperatures and fast charge/discharge current regimes) for an energy storage device to be successfully exploited into the large-scale market of electric/hybrid electric transportation [16]. Since the pioneering works detailing the discovery of ionic conduction in polymer electrolytes by Fenton et al. [17] and Armand et al. [18], research and development in LIB electrolytes explored various systems [19], targeting the switch from all-liquid to all-solid state systems or, at least, realising a good compromise in the form of gel-type materials [20]. The ultimate goal, however, is the complete replacement of commonly used organic carbonate-based liquid electrolytes with non-flammable and leakage-free systems, characterized by sufficiently high Li+ ion mobility, low reactivity towards the other cell components (particularly, the lithium metal electrode [21,22]), and a wide electrochemical stability window [9]. In this regard, the incorporation of room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) into polymer systems represents a very promising approach for overcoming the ambient temperature ionic conductivity drawback of the neat polymer electrolytes [23]. For instance, it was successfully demonstrated that the incorporation of RTILs enhances the ionic conductivity of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-based electrolytes to values exceeding 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C without any decrease in electrochemical stability [23,24], allowing lithium polymer batteries with very good cycling performance at near ambient temperature.  
尽管其作用通常被认为是微不足道的，但找到合适的电解质（通常是指由盐和溶剂组成的溶液）是生产持久LIB的关键组分。事实上，合适的电解质系统的发展可能是克服发生的老化现象并在安全性方面达到必要要求的最基本的门槛（即不燃性，长期循环时的稳定性以及严重的应力作用。用于储能装置的极高/低温和快速充电/放电电流状态可成功地用于电动/混合动力电动运输的大规模市场[16]。自开拓性工作以来，Fenton等人详述了聚合物电解质中离子传导的发现。 [17]和Armand等人。 [18]，LIB电解质的研究和开发探索了各种系统[19]，目标是从全液态到全固态系统的转换，或者至少实现凝胶型材料形式的良好折衷[20] 。然而，最终目标是完全取代常用的有机碳酸盐基液体电解质，采用不易燃和无泄漏的系统，其特点是具有足够高的Li +离子迁移率，对其他电池组件（特别是锂金属）的低反应性电极[21,22]）和宽电化学稳定窗[9]。在这方面，将室温离子液体（RTIL）结合到聚合物体系中代表了克服纯聚合物电解质的环境温度离子传导性缺陷的非常有前景的方法[23]。例如，成功地证明了RTILs的加入将聚（环氧乙烷）（PEO）基电解质的离子电导率提高到25°C时超过10-4Scm-1的值，而电化学稳定性没有任何降低[23] ，24]，使锂聚合物电池在接近环境温度下具有非常好的循环性能。

Considering the above-discussed scenario and the existing knowledge, within the framework of the EU-funded (FP7) MARS-EV project (http://www.mars-ev.eu/homepage), we have developed various kinds of polymer electrolyte systems, including all solid, gel and composite polymer electrolytes [[25], [26], [27]]. In most of the cases, they are prepared by thermal- and/or UV-induced free radical polymerization and thoroughly characterized regarding their physical, chemical and electrochemical properties. Processing is simple, eco-friendly and even adaptable to battery fabrication methods to improve the interfacial contact by means of direct in situ polymerization [[24], [25], [26]]. The search for viable, hydrophobic RTILs to be employed as plasticisers in polymer electrolytes focused on cation/anion combinations, which were proven to be suitable for LIBs [28]. For example, aromatic (imidazolium) or non-aromatic (pyrrolidinium) cyclic cations and hydrophobic perfluorosulfonylimide anions were thoroughly considered as well as mixtures thereof [29]. RTILs were synthesized through a sustainable, eco-friendly route, which exploits water as the only processing solvent instead of toxic and volatile organic compounds [30]. The polymer cells comprising the herein developed polymer membranes encompassing selected RTIL(s), serving simultaneously as electrolyte and separator, demonstrate very good long-term charge/discharge cycling for more than 1200 cycles when employed in Li-rich NMC-based half-cells. As a result, the herein presented thorough investigation in terms of physicochemical and electrochemical features highlights the promising prospects of these solid, high working potential electrolyte systems for realising truly safe, high-performing rechargeable lithium-based batteries.
考虑到上述情况和现有知识，在欧盟资助的（FP7）MARS-EV项目（http://www.mars-ev.eu/homepage）的框架内，我们开发了各种聚合物电解质系统，包括所有固体，凝胶和复合聚合物电解质[[25]，[26]，[27]]。在大多数情况下，它们通过热和/或紫外诱导的自由基聚合制备，并且在物理，化学和电化学性质方面进行了彻底的表征。加工简单，环保，甚至适用于电池制造方法，通过直接原位聚合改善界面接触[[24]，[25]，[26]]。在聚合物电解质中用作增塑剂的可行的疏水性RTIL的研究集中于阳离子/阴离子组合，这被证明适用于LIB [28]。例如，彻底考虑芳族（咪唑鎓）或非芳族（吡咯烷鎓）环状阳离子和疏水性全氟磺酰亚胺阴离子以及它们的混合物[29]。 RTIL通过可持续的，环保的途径合成，利用水作为唯一的加工溶剂而不是有毒和挥发性有机化合物[30]。包含本文开发的聚合物膜的聚合物电池包含选择的RTIL，同时用作电解质和隔膜，当用于富含Li的NMC基半电池时，表现出非常好的长期充电/放电循环超过1200次循环。因此，本文提出的在物理化学和电化学特征方面的彻底调查突出了这些固体，高工作电位电解质系统用于实现真正安全，高性能的可充电锂基电池的有希望的前景。
